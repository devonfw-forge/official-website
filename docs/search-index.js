This article porposes a concrete guideline on implementing a layered architecture. This includes the definition of layers, a rule set on dependencies between those layers and a concrete proposal for folder and package names. Focus on the technical architecture. No proposals on business splits will be made. The layered architecture can be used in services of a microservice architecture or in monoliths. The focus here is on a single deployable artifact independent of its size. The layered architecture is independent of the higher architecture. Only back-end services are considered here. This chapter explains the layered architecture, the single layers and rules to follow. Figure 1. Layered Architecture Reference The Layered Architecture Reference focuses on the back-end service A that consists of two business components. The components are divided into following layers: Service layer Exposes functionality of the back-end to the client or other consumers. Batch layer Exposes functionality to be used in batch-processes (e.g. mass imports). Logic layer Contains the business logic. Domain layer The domain layer manages the domain entities. This usually includes their persistence. The client uses the service endpoints of the back-end service. It is divided into the same business components as the backend with only the client layer. Front-end services are not in focus of the Java stack. The client layer is added for completeness. devonfw supports clients based on single page applications with Angular with devon4ts. The dependencies and call directions follow a few strict rules. In the layered architecture reference those dependencies are displayed by a blue connector. Inside the same component (e.g. Component A1) the following rules adhere: Each layer can only depend on resources from the same layer or from the layer below. A1 UseCases in the logic layer might depend on the interfaces from the domain layer or have a dependency to another use-case from the same component in the logic layer. A layer can never depend on a layer above. The domain layer should never depend on the logic layer. Layers should not be skipped. The service layer should not depend on the domain layer directly. In the layered architecture reference those dependencies are displayed by a orange connector. Inside the same service, but across components (e.g. Component A1 calls Component A2)the following rules adhere: The business architecture defines which components can depend on each other. It highly depends on the business rules if two components are allowed to depend on each other For the next rules it is assumed that Component A1 is allowed to call Component A2. Only the logic layer can have dependencies on other use cases from other components, because it is a business dependency. The logic layer of Component A1 depends on the logic layer of Component A2. The Service layer of Component A1 should not have a dependency to any other layer in Component A2 The Logic Layer of Component A1 should not have a dependency to the domain or the service layer in Component A2 The Domain Layer of Component A1 should not have a dependency to any other layer in Component A2 In the layered architecture reference those dependencies are displayed by a red connector. Usually services do not work alone, but need further functionality that is made available via interfaces. Dependencies between external services are the most critical ones, because such services are usually not under the teams control. Therefore only a few, but very precise and strict rules are defined: The business architecture defines which service depend on each other. External services can only depend on the exposed interfaces of the service layer. Other layer should never expose their functionality to external services. The only layer that can depend on external services is the logic layer. For services with a very limited number of use cases and exposed endpoints, that are also planned to stay small, the three layers might be an overhead. In such cases it might be an option to combine the logic and service layer. Logic and domain layers should never be combined. For large modulith systems further rules and stricter divisions might be necessary. A possible way to handle this is to keep API and Implementation even stricter separated. The folder structure should be aligned with the maven standard directory layout. All sources belonging to the project should be located under src/main in corresponding subfolders. Obvious sources are Java source code and static resources that are used. Other sources like Dockerfiles, helm charts, kubernetes configurations, scripts, etc. should be located in src/main as well. The following examples shows a potential folder structure, that might be extended based on the need. Folders should only be created and used if they have content. ├──/src | ├──/main | | ├──/docker | | ├──/helm | | ├──/java | | └──/resources | └──/test | ├──/java | └──/resources └──/pom.xml The package structure inside src/main/java should represent the (business) components and align with the layered architecture. «root».«component».«layer»[.«detail»] Segments of package schema Segment Description Example «root» The basic Java package namespace of the application. According to the Java package name rules the root should consist of «group».«artifact» where «group» is the organization owning the code.

The following table explains the layers and their possible detail packages: «layer» «detail» service In case multiple protocols are used in the service layer, it might make sense to create a «detail» package for each protocol. Typical protocols are REST or gRPC. For versioning of the APIs further sub-packages can be created. logic No details expected domain Use repository for repository and dao for DAOs. Entities belong into model. common If common gets that big that further separation is necessary detail packages can be created. A high amount of layer unrelated implementations is often considered an anti pattern.

Establish static code analysis using SonarQube and related tools such as Checkstyle to verify it. (Configuration files are broadly available) Use short but speaking names. Use Latin alphanumeric ASCII characters and common technical separator (e.g. underscore). For package segments and type names prefer singular forms. Only use plural forms when there is no singular or it is really semantically required. Names of classes, interfaces, enums or annotations should be unique within your project unless intentionally desired. Avoid artificial naming constructs such as prefixes (I*) or suffixes (*IF) for interfaces. Use CamelCase even for abbreviations (XmlUtil instead of XMLUtil). Names of Generics should be easy to understand. Follow the common rule E=Element, T=Type, K=Key, V=Value. Use longer names for more specific cases such as ID, DTO or ENTITY. Use capitalized naming helps to distinguish a generic type from a regular class. APIs are properly documented with JavaDoc. In Javadoc express information not already available in the signature. {@link} tags in JavaDoc make it more expressive. Describe how to use the type or method and not the implementation. Implementation details should be documented inline in complex cases. Use @Override instead of {@inheritDoc}. Since Java 1.5 @Override annotation inherits {@inheritDoc}. Do not bind your code to implementations such as Vector or ArrayList instead of List. Use Collection instead of List or Set where the difference does not matter. Consider Collection when Foo is an interface or super-class. When catching exceptions always ensure the following: Never call printStackTrace() method on an exception. Either log or wrap and re-throw the entire catched exception. Do not do both. When wrapping and re-throwing an exception ensure that the catched exception is passed as cause. When logging an exception ensure that the entire exception is passed as argument to the logger. (See the throwable argument in logback). Resources such as streams or transactions need to be handled properly: Do not deal with such resources manually where possible. (E.g. @Transactional over manual transaction handling where possible). Use try-with-resources statement. Whenever possible prefer unicode (UTF-8 or better) as encoding. Do not cast from byte to char. Always explicitly use an according western locale (e.g. toLowerCase(Locale.US)). See the following discussion on stackoverflow. Write your code independent from the default encoding (system property file.encoding). Always provide an encoding when you create a String from byte[]: new String(bytes, encoding). Always provide an encoding when you create a Reader or Writer : new InputStreamReader(inStream, encoding). Avoid using the object type Boolean. // bad public Boolean isEmpty { return size() == 0; } // fine public boolean isEmpty { return size() == 0; } Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) classes do have a scope that defines their reuse. Do not store state in CDI classes except for documented reasons For further references on the scopes in spring and quarkus see: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-bean-scopes https://quarkus.io/guides/cdi-reference#supported_features Avoid using byte[] for BLOBs as this will load them entirely into your memory. This will cause performance issues or out of memory errors. Instead, use streams when dealing with BLOBs. See also the specific article about storing BLOBs Do not use Optional for every parameter or result to express that it may be null. Use @Nullable`or `@NotNull to clarify the expectation. Further good practices on optionals can be found here: https://www.baeldung.com/java-optional https://www.baeldung.com/java-optional-return Basic good practices are described here: https://www.baeldung.com/java-8-lambda-expressions-tips Additionally, the following rules should be applied: Using parallelStream() in general code that will run on server side can have unexpected side effects.

The most prominent example might be the database config for dev and prod. Imagine on dev a h2 is used, whereas in prod a PostgreSQL instance needs to be connected. In Spring there’re multiple ways to configure and use profiles: Profile specific files can be used to store profile related config. By setting spring.profiles.active to one of the profiles, the selected profile is considered. Using spring.config.activate.on-profile in different property files, that mark those properties as configuration of a certain profile. Again the profile needs to be set form outside. Using external application properties that reside outside the jar It has proven a good practices to use external application properties in combination with defaults inside the jar. Therefore, the following properties files are used in devonfw application: src/main/resources/application.properties providing a default configuration - bundled and deployed with the application package. It further acts as a template to derive a tailored minimal environment-specific configuration. src/main/resources/config/application.properties providing additional properties only used at development time (for all local deployment scenarios). This property file is excluded from all packaging. src/test/resources/config/application.properties providing additional properties only used for testing. For other environments where the software gets deployed such as test, acceptance and production a tailored copy of application.properties needs to be provided. The name will stay application.properties and the location depends on the deployment strategy: standalone run-able Spring Boot App using embedded tomcat: config/application.properties under the installation directory of the spring boot application. dedicated tomcat (one tomcat per app): $CATALINA_BASE/lib/config/application.properties tomcat serving a number of apps (requires expanding the wars): $CATALINA_BASE/webapps//WEB-INF/classes/config In this application.properties the minimum set of properties that are environment specific are defined everything else is inherited from the bundled src/main/resources/application.properties. In any case, it needs to be sure that the classloader will find the file. As a best practice the configuration properties should follow these naming conventions: build the property-name as a path of segments separated by the dot character (.) segments should get more specific from left to right a property-name should either be a leaf value or a tree node (prefix of other property-names) but never both! So never have something like foo.bar=value and foo.bar.child=value2. start with a segment namespace unique to the context or application a good example would be «myapp».billing.service.email.sender for the sender address of billing service emails send by «myapp». Storing credentials as plain text in configuration files is not an option. Plain text credentials or private keys should never be stored or written down, except in dedicated secret stores. Never commit any plain text credentials in the source code management systems. Those systems are designed to never forget anything! In case any secrets were stored in scm the history needs to be cleaned to completely remove it from scm. Encryption partly solves this problem. The plain text credentials are encrypted using a strong algorithm and masterpassword. The encrypted password is useless for anybody not knowing the masterpassword. The masterpassword needs to be provided to the system in a secure way. Providing the password is the challenge in this scenario. How and if the password can be provided securely depends highly on the environment. For encryption jasypt can be used. Spring Quarkus Use the Spring Boot Jasypt starter. The github repository delivers a god documentation: https://github.com/ulisesbocchio/jasypt-spring-boot The default encryption options and the algorithm PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256 are considered secure enough. For Quarkus there’s currently no known ready to use library. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67159572/how-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-using-jasypt-in-quarkus-for-database-password The most secure way of providing secrets to the application is using a dedicate secret store.

Java SEs ResourceBundle for localizing messages. Java SEs MessageFormat for formatting the messages (for example variable replacement) For more complex translations, use the ICU MessageFormat library. Not only text needs internationalization. Also consider: Numbers Dates Currency Check Java SEs MessageFormat for further links on specialized formatters. To test ICU patterns, use this Demo page. Do not store key value pairs of messages and the corresponding localized message in code. Always create a default property and localized properties in the same folder to make it easy to keep them in sync. The language files should store a speaking key and a pattern containing the text to translate. Always use the country code in combination with the language code. This is no big overhead at the beginning and future proof. All language files are stored in the following structure. src/main/ ├─ resources/ │ ├─ i18n/ │ │ ├─ [{moduleName}]/ │ │ │ ├─ message.properties │ │ │ ├─ message_de_DE.properties │ │ │ ├─ message_en_US.properties │ │ │ ├─ message_[{languageCode}]_{countryCode}].properties To make it easy to translate messages inside the application, it’s recommended to use an enum pattern. The keys are referenced in an enum so that they can be easily used in code. The messages can be split according to the needs into different modules. For each module, an own enum is created. The enums have a translation method leading to an easy translation into the selected locale. View the code snipped BookingMessages for an example. For the translation, the enums call a translator that encapsulates the library. This wrapper makes it easy to change the library in later. For example, when starting without ICU and pluralization is required later, it’s easy to switch out the native Message Formatter with the ICU Message Formatter. View the code snipped MessageTranslator for an example. BookingMessages MessageTranslator message_en_US.properties public enum BookingMessages { WELCOME(\"welcome\"),(1) BOOKING_DATE_SHORT(\"bookingDateShort\"); private final String value; private static final String MESSAGE_BUNDLE_NAME = \"booking\"; (2) private static final MessageTranslator MESSAGE_TRANSLATOR = MessageTranslator.getInstance(MESSAGE_BUNDLE_NAME); (3) public BookingMessage(value) { ... } public String translate(Locale locale, Map arguments) { (4) return MESSAGE_TRANSLATOR.translate(this.value, locale, arguments); } public String translate() { return MESSAGE_TRANSLATOR.translate(this.value, Locale.getDefault(), Collections.emptyMap()); } public String translate(Locale locale) { return MESSAGE_TRANSLATOR.translate(this.value, locale, Collections.emptyMap()); } public String translate(Map arguments) { return MESSAGE_TRANSLATOR.translate(this.value, Locale.getDefault(), arguments); } } 1 One enum per message. The value is the message key in the properties file 2 The name of the location of the corresponding message bundle (/i18n//messages/) 3 The translator for messages. 4 A translation method using the translator, overloaded to make it easier to use in code The MessageTranslator class uses a singleton pattern. There should be one MessageTranslator instance per group of messages (in this example booking). The group of messages is defined by the folder in which the message_.properties files are located. Each MessageTranslator has an ResourceBundle per Locale. When a messageKey should be translated into a locale message, the translator looks up the ResourceBundle for the locale and returns the message from it. Then ICU4J is used to format the message and replace variables. In this example, maps are used to allow named parameters. When using the native Message Formatter, this is not possible. public class MessageTranslator { private final static ConcurrentHashMap instances = new ConcurrentHashMap <>(); (1) private final ConcurrentHashMap bundleMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>(); (2) private final String BASE_DIRECTORY_NAME = \"i18n\"; private final String MESSAGE_PROPERTY_PREFIX = \"message\"; private final String messageBundleName; (3) private MessageTranslator(String messageBundleName){...} public static MessageTranslator getInstance(String messageBundleName) {(1) return instances.computeIfAbsent(messageBundleName, MessageTranslator::new); } private String getPattern(String patternKey, Locale locale){(4) ResourceBundle bundle = bundleMap.computeIfAbsent(locale, (key) -> ResourceBundle.getBundle( String.join(\"/\", BASE_DIRECTORY_NAME, messageBundleName, MESSAGE_PROPERTY_PREFIX), key, Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() ) ); return bundle.getString(patternKey); } public String translate(String patternKey, Locale locale, Map arguments){ String pattern = getPattern(patternKey, locale); MessageFormat messageFormat = new MessageFormat(pattern, locale); StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer(); return messageFormat.format(arguments, stringBuffer, new FieldPosition(0)).toString();(5) } } 1 A MessageTranslator instance exists for each group of messages. Make sure to use thread safe code. 2 A MessageTranslator instance has a ResourceBundle per locale. 3 The messageBundles are stored in the same folder with the pattern i18n//message_.properties 4 Returns the message from the locale-specific ResourceBundle using the bundleMap. 5 Uses the ICU’s MessageFormat to format the message based on the arguments and the locale. welcome=Welcome {name} bookingDateShort=Your table is booked at {bookingDate, date, short}. (1) 1 Will return the date in a numeric format depending on LOCALE (e.g. 24.10.22 in german or 10/24/22 in US). See ICU Formatting details. String bookingDateText = BookingMessages.BOOKING_DATE_SHORT.translate(Map.of(\"bookingDate\", date)); System.out.println(bookingDateText); //OUT: Your table is booked at 10/24/22. In this example, the constant BOOKING_DATE_SHORT from the enum BookingMessages is used to call the \"translate\" function. The \"translate\" function is then using the MessageTranslator to convert the message into the current locale language. To make this possible, the translator is using a ResourceBundler to obtain the message text from the message.properties file and the Messageformatter to replace the placeholder with the input variable containing the date. After the translation, the message is returned. The accept-language header indicates the natural language and locale of the client. This should always result in a Content-Language header in the response. If a user is authenticated, this user might have some localization preferences. Those settings might be stored in the application itself (e.g. the database) or in the authentication system (e.g. LDAP). The localization specifics might also result from business specific indicators (e.g. A flag in a message or defined values).

Consider Logback as implementation in Spring Consider JBoss Log Manager and the JBoss Logging facade as implementation in Quarkus The private static final member storing the logger instance should be called log. When the configuration of the logger is environment specific the configuration should be stored in a separate file. To make it possible to filter the log messages, there are different log levels to express the nature of the logged message. There is a common understanding how this log levels should be used and which messages should be logged with which log level: Log levels Log-level logger function Description Impact FATAL error with a marker Only used for fatal errors that prevent the application to work at all (e.g. startup fails or shutdown/restart required) Operator has to react immediately ERROR error An abnormal error indicating that the processing failed due to technical problems. Operator should check for known issue and otherwise inform development WARNING warn A situation where something worked not as expected. E.g. a business exception or user validation failure occurred. No direct reaction required. Used for problem analysis. INFO info Important information such as context, duration, success/failure of request or process No direct reaction required. Used for analysis. DEBUG debug Development information that provides additional context for debugging problems. No direct reaction required. Used for analysis. TRACE trace Like DEBUG but exhaustive information and for code that is run very frequently. Will typically cause large log-files. No direct reaction required. Used for problem analysis. Exceptions (with their stack trace) should only be logged on FATAL or ERROR level. For business exceptions typically a WARNING including the message of the exception is sufficient. When the application is executed on different environments it is a best practice to activate certain log levels depending on the type of the environment: Log levels in different environments Log-level Active Environments FATAL all ERROR all WARNING all INFO all DEBUG development and testing TRACE none (turned off by default) To prevent log file from getting to big it is a best practice to use rolling log files. This means that following a list of rules the logger will start logging to a new file. The frequency of the rolling depends on the amount of log message and on the file size the file system and the applications, used to view the logs, can handle.

It is important to catch all exceptions and map them to a meaningful result and not pass implementation details to the outside. If not handled correct a generated error message is send to the client. RFC7807 defines a \"problem detail\" so no new response formats need to be defined. It’s recommended to go with the described format. In the following chapters a few recommendations based on the RFC are documented The RFC describes at least title and instance to be URIs. Often readers imagine callable URLs at this place, which leads to a lot of complex solutions ideas. Consider using URNs instead of URLs to be most flexible and still aligning with the specification. The type should be a URN that identifies the underlying error. Use urn:problem: as type. should identify the underlying error and should not change. The classname e.g. is not a good error-code as it might change due to refactoring work. It’s best to have a mapping of exception class to error-code. It’s recommended to use a String representation of the error like ValidationError, ResourceNotFound. But it could also be a number. The title should be a human understandable definition of the type. The same type should always match to the same title. E.g.: ValidationError - The request was not valid. ResourceNotFound - A resource was not found The details can be used to provide further information like the Validation Problems or the id and type of the resource that was not found. The instance should identify the concrete error that occurs. It’s recommended to use a UUID to define this. urn:uuid: In cases where there’s a trace-id this could be used. This way it’s easiest for the operations team to quickly identify the requests related to the error. If no ID can be reused that marks the error instance, a new UUID should be created and logged out together with helpful information. OpenAPI can be used to define and generate the problem details. This is especially helpful, when additional attributes are used, that are not defined by the specification. That way the caller can expect further information and display it. When inheritance for the problem details is used in the OpenAPI spec, define an additional _schema attribute as discriminator for the concrete type. For more details take a look at the openAPI specification. Special exceptions have clear requirements regarding the information that is exposed. HTTP status code 403 (FORBIDDEN) type about:blank title \"forbidden\" details empty instance An identifier (generally the correlation id) to help identify corresponding requests in logs Validation errors include all validation issues that do not fullfil the requirements, because it is a tedious work to figure out and fix all errors request by request.

For the client-side, it’s easier to send requests to the Api by using a generated Api client For the server-side, stubs are generated as interfaces to implement There are different types of generators, it is suggested to use the OpenApi Generator. It’s sugessted to use the maven/gradle plugin version for the client and server. For the client, there is also a cli tool. Create an openapi.yaml file from the Api and move it into the main/resources folder. Configure the openapi generator maven plugin inside the pom.xml. The code generated for the server should be located under .generated.api The code generated for the client should be located under .generated.client When generating a client, the client encapsulates the HttpClient library, making it easy to exchange. The library can be set by changing the library option inside the plugin configuration. Some minor changes need to be done when changing the library. For native Java library, the method for changing the server path is updateBaseUri. For other libraries, it is setBasePath. When switching, this needs to be changed. See the example for the details. Dependent on the library, error handling can be different. A detailed guide on how to use the generated client code can be found here The ApiClient should be configured in a Configuration Bean named {[ApiName]}Config It is possible that the server url is already set inside the openapi.yaml file. You can set/overwrite the server path of the Api inside the application.properties using the configuration bean. For different http libraries, the configuration bean has to be changed.

REST and RESTful often implies very strict and specific rules and conventions. Usage of HTTP methods HTTP Method RESTful Meaning Recommendations GET Read single element. Search on an entity (with parametrized url) Read a single element. PUT Replace entity data. Replace entire collection (typically not supported) Not recommended POST Create a new element in the collection Create or update an element in the collection. Search on an entity (parametrized post body) Bulk deletion. DELETE Delete an entity. Delete an entire collection (typically not supported) Delete an entity. Delete an entire collection (typically not supported) The table above shows some differences between the RESTful meaning of the HTTP methods and the recommended way of implementation, that results from a lot of lessons learned in various projects. GET-requests do have some limitations. URL’s are limited in length which makes them inappropriate for an unknown number of search parameters. Server’s might log the URL’s which could lead to logging of sensitive data, when a lot of parameters are used. Recommendation on search implementation: Keep all searches as POST-requests Put the search parameter in the request-body. See also https://stackoverflow.com/a/18933902 as explanation This keeps the API consistent for all request filtering for certain entities. The verb PUT does not directly shout update, which can lead to discussions around the usage of PUT and regular confusions. As a pragmatic solution to this reoccurring problem the recommendation is to not use PUT at all. The difference between creating of an entity and updating of an entity does not need an own verb. Instead the existence of an entity identifier in the POST-request body identifies an UPDATE. Whereas the absence of the identifier in the in the body marks it’s creation. In addition to the already mentioned tasks, the POST-request is responsible for BULK deletions. DELETE should not have a body and the URLs are limited in their length. Therefore, there’s a limit in number of entities that can be bulk deleted. To stay consistent across bulk deletions independent of their size, it is recommended to use POST-requests and send the entities marked for bulk deletion in the body. For URLs following rules are defined: * Only lower case letters * Hyphens separate words A basic URL should be build up like this. This basic part will be referenced as in following examples: https://://[services]/[]/[]/[]/ URL-prefix Placeholder Description The name of the application. In case the host name already identifies the name of the application, it is redundant to add the name of the app to the URL. services services can be written into the path to differentiate the path to APIs from e.g. static content. In case no differentiation is needed and will probably never be, it can be left out. In case multiple protocols might be supported, it makes sense to distinguish them e.g. rest or grpc. In case the service is divided into multiple business components, it’s beneficial to put the business component into the URL. In case of microservices for example the buisness component would be often redundant to the app name. In case versioning of the API is planned, the version should be made available in the URL from the very first version on. For operations in REST the following types of URLs are distinguished: Collection URL Build from the rest service URL by appending the name of a collection, which is typically the name of an entity. Example: /myentity Element URL Identifies a single entity within the collection. Build from a collection URL by appending the element ID. Example: /myentity/42 Business Operation URLs The business operations (processing, calculation, advanced search, etc.) is appended to the collection URL. Business operations should always be used in combination with POST. Example: /myentity/search Always use singular forms and avoid confusions (except for the rare cases where no singular exists). An entity that should be provided with a different structure should become an own collection instead of appending the details to the entity URL. /myentity-with-details/42 instead of /myentity/42/with-details. A complete example could look like this: https://mydomain.de:9080/my-thay-star/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/42 A detailed list and explanation of status codes can be found here: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-status-codes. A condensed list is available here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes The payload of a REST service can be in any format as REST by itself does not specify this. The most established ones in practice are XML (application/xml) and JSON (application/json). The recommendation is JSON, if not defined by API consumers. Do not mix formats in the same service. If this should be necessary document the reason. HTTP Method: GET URL example: https://mydomain.de:9080/my-thay-star/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/42 For loading of a single resource, embed the identifier (e.g. 42) of the resource in the URL. The response contains the resource in JSON format, using a JSON object at the top-level. HTTP Method: GET URL example: https://mydomain.de:9080/my-thay-star/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order The response contains all entities of the collection in JSON format, using a JSON object at the top-level, and the actual collection underneath a result key. HTTP Method: POST URL example: https://mydomain.de:9080/my-thay-star/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order The resource will be passed via JSON in the request body. If updating an existing resource, include the resource’s identifier in the JSON and not in the URL, in order to avoid ambiguity. If saving was successful, the updated product (e.g. with assigned ID or updated modification counter) is returned. HTTP Method: POST URL example: https://mydomain.de:9080/my-thay-star/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/search In order to differentiate from an unparameterized load, the subpath search is introduced. The parameters are passed via JSON in the request body. HTTP Method: DELETE URL example: https://mydomain.de:9080/my-thay-star/services/rest/ordermanagement/v1/order/42 For deletion of a single resource, embed the identifier of the resource in the URL.

Hibernate is the has proven to be a reliable implementation of JPA. Use the JPA where ever possible and use vendor (hibernate) specific features only for situations when JPA does not provide a solution. In the latter case consider first if you really need the feature. Entities should be named Entity Repositories should be named Repository Entities must be simple POJOs and not contain business logic. There’s a number of columns (attributes) each entity should contain: Add a private Long id The id needs to be annotated with @Id. The id uses database sequence for generation of the id. @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE). Use Long as type because it is the most efficient representation for the database. Therefore looking up a record and joins are faster compared to e.g. String or UUID. Add a private int modificationCounter. The modification counter is used as version of the entity for optimistic locking. Whenever the object gets modified and persisted this counter will be increased. Use int for the modification counter. Annotate the modification counter with @Version. Byte array will cause problems if BLOBs get large because the entire BLOB is loaded into the RAM. Use the datatype Blob. Stream the BLOB directly from the database to the user when the data is requested via an API. Always use TemporalType.TIMESTAMP with @Temporal. Mixing with other granularities causes problems when comparing one value to another. Application are strongly advised to always use lazy loading. Always override the default of the relationship annotation by providing fetch = FetchType.LAZY, even if this is the default already. Mapping enums to their ordinal or name is fragile when it comes to code changes and refactoring. Define a dedicated string in each enum value for database representation. Enums then have to be treated as a custom datatype with a converter. There are several ways to handle inheritance in databases. In most cases, 'single table' should be used, because it is usually the fastest way to do the mapping, as no joins are needed when retrieving, searching or persisting entities. For each entity «EntityName»Entity an interface is created with the name «EntityName»Repository extending JpaRepository. The @Query annotation is used for easy cases where the needed results can be found by a simple SQL query. In Quarkus, native and named queries via the @Query annotation are currently not supported. So in Quarkus fragments have to be used. https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.custom-implementations When dealing with large amounts of data, an efficient method of retrieving the data is required. Paging is used to process only small subsets of the entire data set. If you are using Spring Data repositories you will get pagination support out of the box by providing the interfaces Page and Pageable. When iterating over 1:n and n:m this most likely will end up in performance problems due to the N+1 problem. This means one query is used to fetch the entity and N queries are used to fetch the related entities. To avoid the N+1 problem create special functions to load the entity with the related entities Repo.findByWithById(id). This will solve the problem with one query. To do that join the tables of the entity and the related entities. load the related entities with the repository of the related entity Repo.findById(id). This will solve the problem with two queries if the entity and the related entities are needed and with one query if only the related entities are needed. Never build queries with string concatenation or your code might be vulnerable through SQL-Injections. Consider using Query parameters. Operate the application with a database user that has limited permissions so the user can not modify the SQL schema (e.g. drop tables). For initializing the schema (DDL) or to do schema migrations use a separate user that is not used by the application itself.

Security Model The Identity- and Access-Management is provided by according products and typically already available in the enterprise landscape (e.g. an active directory). It provides a hierarchy of primary access control objects (roles and groups) of a user. An administrator can grant and revoke permissions (indirectly) via this way. The application security defines a hierarchy of secondary access control objects (groups and permissions). This is done by configuration owned by the application (see following section). The \"API\" is defined by the IDs of the primary access control objects that will be referenced from the Identity- and Access-Management. Security terms related to authorization Term Meaning and comment Authorization Verification that an authenticated user is allowed to perform the operation he intends to invoke Permission A permission is an object that allows a principal to perform an operation in the system. This permission can be granted (give) or revoked (taken away). Group A group contains permissions. A group may also contain other groups. Role A role is as a specific form of group that also contains permissions. A role identifies a specific function of a principal. A user can act in a role. For simple scenarios a principal has a single role associated. In more complex situations a principal can have multiple roles but has only one active role at a time that he can choose out of his assigned roles. For KISS it is sometimes sufficient to avoid this by creating multiple accounts for the few users with multiple roles. Access Control Any permission, group, role, etc., which declares a control for access management. For the access model we give the following suggestions: Each Access Control (permission, group, role, …​) is uniquely identified by a human readable string. A unique permission is created for each use-case. Groups combine permissions to typical and useful sets for the users. Roles act as specific groups as required by our business demands. Users can be associated with a list of Access Controls. For authorization of an implemented use case the required permissions are determined. A security exception is thrown if the user does not have the required permissions. A user has no permission by default and only those granted to him explicitly give him additional permission for specific things. Permissions granted can not be reduced by other permissions. Permissions are secrets of the application. Administrators shall not fiddle with individual permissions but grant them via groups. So the access management provides a list of strings identifying the Access Controls of a user. The individual application itself contains these Access Controls in a structured way, whereas each group forms a permission tree. As stated above each Access Control is uniquely identified by a human readable string. This string should follow the naming convention: «app-id».«local-name» For Access Control Permissions the «local-name» again follows the convention: «verb»«object» The segments are defined by the following table: Segments of Access Control Permission ID Segment Description Example «app-id» Is a unique technical but human readable string of the application (or microservice). It shall not contain special characters and especially no dot or whitespace. We recommend to use lower-train-case-ascii-syntax. The identity and access management should be organized on enterprise level rather than application level. Therefore permissions of different apps might easily clash (e.g. two apps might both define a group ReadMasterData but some user shall get this group for only one of these two apps). Using the «app-id». prefix is a simple but powerful namespacing concept that allows you to scale and grow. You may also reserve specific «app-id»s for cross-cutting concerns that do not actually reflect a single app e.g to grant access to a geographic region. shop «verb» The action that is to be performed on «object». Find shall be used for searching and reading data. Save shall be used for create and update. Create should only be used in addition to Save when there’s a concrete demand. Finally, Delete is used for deletions. For non CRUD actions additional verbs such as Approve or Reject can be used. Find «object» The affected object or entity.

Angular gives an opinion on how to look at architecture. It is a component based like devon4j but uses different terms which are common language in web application development. The important term is module which is used instead of component. The primary reason is the naming collision with the Web Components standard (see Web Components). To clarify this: A component describes an UI element containing HTML, CSS and JavaScript - structure, design and logic encapsulated inside a reusable container called component. A module describes an applications feature area. The application flight-app may have a module called booking. An application developed using Angular consists of multiple modules. There are feature modules and special modules described by the Angular Style Guide - core and shared. Angular or Angular Style Guide give no guidance on how to structure a module internally. This is where this architecture comes in. The architecture describes two layers. The terminology is based on common language in web development. Figure 1. Layers Components Layer encapsulates components which present the current application state. Components are separated into Smart and Dumb Components. The only logic present is view logic inside Smart Components. Services Layer is more or less what we call 'business logic layer' on the server side. The layer defines the applications state, the transitions between state and classic business logic. Stores contain application state over time to which Smart Components subscribe to. Adapters are used to perform XHR, WebSocket connections, etc. The business model is described inside the module. Use case services perform business logic needed for use cases. A use case services interacts with the store and adapters. Methods of use case services are the API for Smart Components. Those methods are Actions in reactive terminology. Angular requires a module called app which is the main entrance to an application at runtime - this module gets bootstrapped. Angular Style Guide defines feature modules and two special modules - core and shared. Figure 2. Modules A feature module is basically a vertical cut through both layers. The shared module consists of components shared across feature modules. The core module holds services shared across modules. So core module is a module only having a services layer and shared module is a module only having a components layer.","title":"Architecture","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"architecture","url":"/typescript/current/angular/architecture.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Layers","hash":"_layers","id":2},{"text":"Modules","hash":"_modules","id":3}]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"The components layer encapsulates all components presenting the current application view state, which means data to be shown to the user. The term component refers to a component described by the standard Web Components. So this layer has all Angular components, directives and pipes defined for an application. The main challenges are: how to structure the components layer (see File Structure Guide) decompose components into maintainable chunks (see Component Decomposition Guide) handle component interaction manage calls to the services layer apply a maintainable data and event flow throughout the component tree The architecture applies the concept of Smart and Dumb Components (syn. Containers and Presenters). The concept means that components are divided into Smart and Dumb Components. A Smart Component typically is a top-level dialog inside the component tree. a component, that can be routed to a modal dialog a component, which is placed inside AppComponent A Dumb Component can be used by one to many Smart Components. Inside the component tree a Dumb Component is a child of a Smart Component. Figure 1. Component tree example As shown the topmost component is always the AppComponent in Angular applications. The component tree describes the hierarchy of components starting from AppComponent. The figure shows Smart Components in blue and Dumb Components in green. AppComponent is a Smart Component by definition. Inside the template of AppComponent placed components are static components inside the component tree. So they are always displayed. In the example OverviewComponent and DetailsComponent are rendered by Angular compiler depending on current URL the application displays. So OverviewComponents sub-tree is displayed if the URL is /overview and DetailsComponents sub-tree is displayed if the URL is /details. To clarify this distinction further the following table shows the main differences. Smart vs Dumb Components Smart Components Dumb Components contain the current view state show data via binding (@Input) and contain no view state handle events emitted by Dumb Components pass events up the component tree to be handled by Smart Components (@Output) call the services layer never call the services layer use services do not use services consists of n Dumb Components is independent of Smart Components With the usage of the Smart and Dumb Components pattern one of the most important part is component interaction. Angular comes with built in support for component interaction with @Input() and @Output() Decorators. The following figure illustrates an unidirectional data flow. Data always goes down the component tree - from a Smart Component down its children. Events bubble up, to be handled by a Smart Component. Figure 2. Smart and Dumb Component Interaction As shown a Dumb Components role is to define a signature by declaring Input and Output Bindings. @Input() defines what data is necessary for that component to work @Output() defines which events can be listened on by the parent component Dumb Components define a signature export class ValuePickerComponent { @Input() columns: string[]; @Input() items: {}[]; @Input() selected: {}; @Input() filter: string; @Input() isChunked = false; @Input() showInput = true; @Input() showDropdownHeader = true; @Output() elementSelected = new EventEmitter(); @Output() filterChanged = new EventEmitter(); @Output() loadNextChunk = new EventEmitter(); @Output() escapeKeyPressed = new EventEmitter(); } The example shows the Dumb Component ValuePickerComponent. It describes seven input bindings with isChunked, showHeader and showDropdownHeader being non mandatory as they have a default value. Four output bindings are present. Typically, a Dumb Component has very little code to no code inside the TypeScript class. Smart Components use the Dumb Components signature inside the template Inside the Smart Components template the events emitted by Dumb Components are handled. It is a good practice to name the handlers with the prefix on* (e.g. onInputChanged()).","title":"Components Layer","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"components-layer","url":"/typescript/current/angular/components-layer.html","titles":[{"text":"Smart and Dumb Components","hash":"_smart_and_dumb_components","id":1},{"text":"Interaction of Smart and Dumb Components","hash":"_interaction_of_smart_and_dumb_components","id":2}]},"28":{"id":28,"text":"The following solution presents a base class for implementing stores which handle state and its transitions.

In comparison, that number is higher than any single browser demographic currently, other than Chrome2. Not considering those users when developing an application means excluding a large number of people from being able to use it comfortable or at all. Some people are unable to use the mouse, view a screen, see low contrast text, Hear dialogue or music and some people having difficulty to understanding the complex language.This kind of people needed the support like Keyboard support, screen reader support, high contrast text, captions and transcripts and Plain language support. This disability may change the from permanent to the situation. Semantic Markup - Allows the application to be understood on a more general level rather than just details of whats being rendered Keyboard Accessibility - Applications must still be usable when using only a keyboard Visual Assistance - color contrast, focus of elements and text representations of audio and events If you’re creating custom element directives, Web Components or HTML in general, use native elements wherever possible to utilize built-in events and properties. Alternatively, use ARIA to communicate semantic meaning. HTML tags have attributes that providers extra context on what’s being displayed on the browser. For example, the tag’s alt attribute lets the reader know what is being shown using a short description.However, native tags don’t cover all cases. This is where ARIA fits in. ARIA attributes can provide context on what roles specific elements have in the application or on how elements within the document relate to each other. A modal component can be given the role of dialog or alertdialog to let the browser know that that component is acting as a modal. The modal component template can use the ARIA attributes aria-labelledby and aria-described to describe to readers what the title and purpose of the modal is. @Component({ selector: 'ngc2-app', template: ` ` }) export class AppComponent { constructor(private modal: ModalService) { } } notification-button.component.ts @Component({ selector: 'ngc2-modal', template: ` {{title}} {{description}} OK ` }) export class ModalComponent { ... } Keyboard accessibility is the ability of your application to be interacted with using just a keyboard. The more streamlined the site can be used this way, the more keyboard accessible it is. Keyboard accessibility is one of the largest aspects of web accessibility since it targets: those with motor disabilities who can’t use a mouse users who rely on screen readers and other assistive technology, which require keyboard navigation those who prefer not to use a mouse Keyboard interaction is driven by something called focus. In web applications, only one element on a document has focus at a time, and keypress will activate whatever function is bound to that element. Focus element border can be styled with CSS using the outline property, but it should not be removed. Elements can also be styled using the :focus psuedo-selector. The most common way of moving focus along the page is through the tab key. Elements will be traversed in the order they appear in the document outline - so that order must be carefully considered during development. There is way change the default behavior or tab order. This can be done through the tabindex attribute. The tabindex can be given the values: * less than zero - to let readers know that an element should be focusable but not keyboard accessible * 0 - to let readers know that that element should be accessible by keyboard * greater than zero - to let readers know the order in which the focusable element should be reached using the keyboard. Order is calculated from lowest to highest. The majority of transitions that happen in an Angular application will not involve a page reload. This means that developers will need to carefully manage what happens to focus in these cases. For example: @Component({ selector: 'ngc2-modal', template: ` {{title}} {{description}} OK `, }) export class ModalComponent { constructor(private modal: ModalService, private element: ElementRef) { } ngOnInit() { this.modal.visible$.subscribe(visible => { if(visible) { setTimeout(() => { this.element.nativeElement.querySelector('button').focus(); }, 0); } }) } } One large category of disability is visual impairment. This includes not just the blind, but those who are color blind or partially sighted, and require some additional consideration. When choosing colors for text or elements on a website, the contrast between them needs to be considered. For WCAG 2.0 AA, this means that the contrast ratio for text or visual representations of text needs to be at least 4.5:1. There are tools online to measure the contrast ratio such as this color contrast checker from WebAIM or be checked with using automation tests. Color can help a user’s understanding of information, but it should never be the only way to convey information to a user. For example, a user with red/green color-blindness may have trouble discerning at a glance if an alert is informing them of success or failure. Audiovisual elements in the application such as video, sound effects or audio (that is, podcasts) need related textual representations such as transcripts, captions or descriptions. They also should never auto-play and playback controls should be provided to the user. The a11y package provides a number of tools to improve accessibility. Import import { A11yModule } from '@angular/cdk/a11y'; ListKeyManager manages the active option in a list of items based on keyboard interaction. Intended to be used with components that correspond to a role=\"menu\" or role=\"listbox\" pattern . Any component that uses a ListKeyManager will generally do three things: Create a @ViewChildren query for the options being managed. Initialize the ListKeyManager, passing in the options. Forward keyboard events from the managed component to the ListKeyManager. Each option should implement the ListKeyManagerOption interface: interface ListKeyManagerOption { disabled?: boolean; getLabel?(): string; } There are two varieties of ListKeyManager, FocusKeyManager and ActiveDescendantKeyManager. Used when options will directly receive browser focus. Each item managed must implement the FocusableOption interface: interface FocusableOption extends ListKeyManagerOption { focus(): void; } Used when options will be marked as active via aria-activedescendant. Each item managed must implement the Highlightable interface: interface Highlightable extends ListKeyManagerOption { setActiveStyles(): void; setInactiveStyles(): void; } Each item must also have an ID bound to the listbox’s or menu’s aria-activedescendant. The cdkTrapFocus directive traps Tab key focus within an element. This is intended to be used to create accessible experience for components like modal dialogs, where focus must be constrained. This directive is declared in A11yModule. This directive will not prevent focus from moving out of the trapped region due to mouse interaction. For example: Regions can be declared explicitly with an initial focus element by using the cdkFocusRegionStart, cdkFocusRegionEnd and cdkFocusInitial DOM attributes. When using the tab key, focus will move through this region and wrap around on either end. For example: Focus region start Link Initially focused Focus region end InteractivityChecker is used to check the interactivity of an element, capturing disabled, visible, tabbable, and focusable states for accessibility purposes. LiveAnnouncer is used to announce messages for screen-reader users using an aria-live region. For example: @Component({...}) export class MyComponent { constructor(liveAnnouncer: LiveAnnouncer) { liveAnnouncer.announce(\"Hey Google\"); } } API reference for Angular CDK a11y","title":"Accessibility","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guide-accessibility","url":"/typescript/current/angular/guide-accessibility.html","titles":[{"text":"Key Concerns of Accessible Web Applications","hash":"_key_concerns_of_accessible_web_applications","id":1},{"text":"Semantic Markup","hash":"_semantic_markup","id":2},{"text":"Keyboard Accessibility","hash":"_keyboard_accessibility","id":3},{"text":"Focus","hash":"_focus","id":4},{"text":"Tabbing","hash":"_tabbing","id":5},{"text":"Transitions","hash":"_transitions","id":6},{"text":"Visual Assistance","hash":"_visual_assistance","id":7},{"text":"Color Contrast","hash":"_color_contrast","id":8},{"text":"Visual Information","hash":"_visual_information","id":9},{"text":"Audiovisual Media","hash":"_audiovisual_media","id":10},{"text":"Accessibility with Angular Material","hash":"_accessibility_with_angular_material","id":11},{"text":"ListKeyManager","hash":"_listkeymanager","id":12},{"text":"Types of ListKeyManager","hash":"_types_of_listkeymanager","id":13},{"text":"FocusKeyManager","hash":"_focuskeymanager","id":14},{"text":"ActiveDescendantKeyManager","hash":"_activedescendantkeymanager","id":15},{"text":"FocusTrap","hash":"_focustrap","id":16},{"text":"Regions","hash":"_regions","id":17},{"text":"InteractivityChecker","hash":"_interactivitychecker","id":18},{"text":"LiveAnnouncer","hash":"_liveannouncer","id":19},{"text":"API reference for Angular CDK a11y","hash":"_api_reference_for_angular_cdk_a11y","id":20}]},"30":{"id":30,"text":"This cookbook recipe explains how to integrate Electron in an Angular 10+ application. Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. As an example, very well known applications as Visual Studio Code, Atom, Slack or Skype (and many more) are using Electron too. At the moment of this writing Angular 11.2.0, Electron 11.2.3 and Electron-builder 22.9.1 were the versions available. Here are the steps to achieve this goal. Follow them in order. There are two different approaches to add the dependencies in the package.json file: Writing the dependencies directly in that file. Installing using npm install or yarn add. Please remember if the project has a package-lock.json or yarn.lock file use npm or yarn respectively. In order to add the dependencies directly in the package.json file, include the following lines in the devDependencies section: \"devDependencies\": { ... \"electron\": \"^11.2.3\", \"electron-builder\": \"^22.9.1\", ... }, As indicated above, instead of this npm install can be used: $ npm install -D electron electron-builder Or with yarn: $ yarn add -D electron electron-builder In order to initiate electron in an angular app we need to modify the tsconfig.json file and create a tsconfig.serve.json and a tsconfig.base.json in the root folder. This file needs to be modified to create references to ./src/tsconfig.app.json and ./src/tsconfig.spec.json to support different configurations. { \"files\": [], \"references\": [ { \"path\": \"./src/tsconfig.app.json\" }, { \"path\": \"./src/tsconfig.spec.json\" } ] } { \"extends\": \"../tsconfig.base.json\", \"compilerOptions\": { \"outDir\": \"../app\", \"module\": \"es2015\", \"baseUrl\": \"\", \"types\": [] }, \"include\": [ \"**/*.ts\", ], \"exclude\": [ \"**/*.spec.ts\" ], \"angularCompilerOptions\": { \"fullTemplateTypeCheck\": true, \"strictInjectionParameters\": true, \"preserveWhitespaces\": true } } { \"extends\": \"../tsconfig.base.json\", \"compilerOptions\": { \"outDir\": \"../spec\", \"module\": \"commonjs\", \"types\": [ \"jasmine\", \"node\" ] }, \"files\": [ \"test.ts\", ], \"include\": [ \"**/*.spec.ts\", \"**/*.d.ts\" ], \"exclude\": [ \"dist\", \"release\", \"node_modules\" ] } This is shared between tsconfig.app.json and tsconfig.spec.json and it will be extended on each config file. { \"compileOnSave\": false, \"compilerOptions\": { \"outDir\": \"./dist\", \"sourceMap\": true, \"declaration\": false, \"moduleResolution\": \"node\", \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true, \"experimentalDecorators\": true, \"target\": \"es5\", \"typeRoots\": [ \"node_modules/@types\" ], \"lib\": [ \"es2017\", \"es2016\", \"es2015\", \"dom\" ] }, \"files\": [ \"electron-main.ts\" \"src/polyfills.ts\" ], \"include\": [ \"src/**/*.d.ts\" ], \"exclude\": [ \"node_modules\" ] } In the root, tsconfig.serve.json needs to be created. This typescript config file is going to be used when we serve electron: { \"compilerOptions\": { \"outDir\": \".\", \"sourceMap\": true, \"declaration\": false, \"moduleResolution\": \"node\", \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true, \"experimentalDecorators\": true, \"target\": \"es5\", \"typeRoots\": [ \"node_modules/@types\" ], \"lib\": [ \"es2017\", \"dom\" ] }, \"include\": [ \"electron-main.ts\" ], \"exclude\": [ \"node_modules\", \"**/*.spec.ts\" ] } In order to configure electron builds properly we need to create a new json on our application, let’s call it electron-builder.json. For more information and fine tuning please refer to the Electron Builder official documentation. The contents of the file will be something similar to the following: { \"productName\": \"devon4ngElectron\", \"directories\":{ \"output\": \"./builder-release\" }, \"win\": { \"icon\": \"dist/assets/icons\", \"target\": [ \"portable\" ] }, \"mac\": { \"icon\": \"dist/assets/icons\", \"target\": [ \"dmg\" ] }, \"linux\": { \"icon\": \"dist/assets/icons\", \"target\": [ \"AppImage\" ] } } There are two important things in this files: \"output\": this is where electron builder is going to build our application \"icon\": in every OS possible there is an icon parameter, the route to the icon folder that will be created after building with angular needs to be used here. This will make it so the electron builder can find the icons and build. angular.json has to to be modified so the project is build inside /dist without an intermediate folder. { \"architect\": { \"build\": { \"outputPath\": \"dist\" } } } In order to use electron, a file needs to be created at the root of the application (main.ts). This file will create a window with different settings checking if we are using --serve as an argument: import { app, BrowserWindow } from 'electron'; import * as path from 'path'; import * as url from 'url'; let win: any; const args: any = process.argv.slice(1); const serve: any = args.some((val) => val === '--serve'); const createWindow:any = ()=>{ // Create the browser window. win = new BrowserWindow({ fullscreen: true, webPreferences: { nodeIntegration: true, } }); if (serve) { require('electron-reload')(__dirname, { electron: require(`${__dirname}/node_modules/electron`) }); win.loadURL('http://localhost:4200'); } else { win.loadURL( url.format({ pathname: path.join(__dirname, 'dist/index.html'), protocol: 'file:', slashes: true }) ); } if (serve) { win.webContents.openDevTools(); } // Emitted when the window is closed. win.on('closed', () => { // Dereference the window object, usually you would store window // in an array if your app supports multi windows, this is the time // when you should delete the corresponding element. // tslint:disable-next-line:no-null-keyword win = null; }); } try { // This method will be called when Electron has finished // initialization and is ready to create browser windows. // Some APIs can only be used after this event occurs. app.on('ready', createWindow); // Quit when all windows are closed. app.on('window-all-closed', () => { // On OS X it is common for applications and their menu bar // to stay active until the user quits explicitly with Cmd + Q if (process.platform !== 'darwin') { app.quit(); } }); app.on('activate', () => { // On OS X it's common to re-create a window in the app when the // dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open. if (win === null) { createWindow(); } }); } catch (e) { // Catch Error // throw e; } Inside package.json the electron window that will be transformed to electron-main.js when building needs to be added. { .... \"main\": \"electron-main.js\", \"scripts\": {...} .... } The scripts section in the package.json can be improved to avoid running too verbose commands. As a very complete example we can take a look to the My Thai Star’s scripts section and copy the lines useful in your project. In any case, at least we recommend to add the following lines: \"scripts\": { \"ng\": \"ng\", \"start\": \"ng serve\", \"build\": \"ng build\", \"test\": \"ng test\", \"lint\": \"ng lint\", \"e2e\": \"ng e2e\", \"electron:tsc\": \"tsc -p tsconfig.serve.json\", \"electron:run\": \"npm run electron:tsc && ng build --base-href ./ && npx electron .\", \"electron:serve\": \"npm run electron:tsc && npx electron . --serve\", \"electron:pack\": \"npm run electron:tsc && electron-builder --dir --config electron-builder.json\", \"electron:build\": \"npm run electron:tsc && electron-builder --config electron-builder.json build\" }, The electron: scripts do the following: electron:tsc: Compiles electron TS files. electron:run: Serves Angular app and runs electron. electron:serve: Serves electron with an already running angular app (i.e. a ng serve command running on another terminal). electron:pack: Packs electron app. electron:build: Builds electron app. Creating an Electron app is very easy and straight-forward if you are using Nx CLI. As a pre-requisite, you should already have an application in your Nx workspace which you want to run as a front-end in your Electron app. (You can follow this guide if you want to get started with Nx). Follow the steps below to develop an Electron app in your Nx workspace: Install nx-electron using the command: npm install -D nx-electron This will add the packages electron and nx-electron as dev dependencies to your Nx workspace. This will help us generate our Electron app in the next step. Once you have installed nx-electron, you can generate your electron app using the command: nx g nx-electron:app --frontendProject= And that is it! You have generated your Electron app already. All the configuration files (tsconfig.*) are generated for you under in your Nx workspace. You can use this command to serve your Electron app: nx run-many --target=serve --projects=, --parallel If you see a blank application, it is because the Electron app was served before the front-end was served. To avoid this, you can serve the front-end and back-end separately, (that is, serve the back-end only after the front-end is served). The command for building your Electron app in Nx is similar to the serve command above, you only change the target from serve to build: nx run-many --target=build --projects=, --parallel Make sure you have build your app before you try to package it using the following command: nx run :package [--options] The options that can be passed can be found here.

Custom elements are a Web Platform feature currently supported by Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari, and available in other browsers through Polyfills. A custom element extends HTML by allowing you to define a tag whose content is created and controlled by JavaScript code. The browser maintains a CustomElementRegistry of defined custom elements (also called Web Components), which maps an instantiable JavaScript class to an HTML tag. Angular Elements allows Angular to work with different frameworks by using input and output elements. This allows Angular to work with many different frameworks if needed. This is an ideal situation if a slow transformation of an application to Angular is needed or some Angular needs to be added in other web applications(For example. ASP.net, JSP etc ) Angular Elements is really powerful but since, the transition between views is going to be handled by another framework or HTML/JavaScript, using Angular Router is not possible. the view transitions have to be handled manually. This fact also eliminates the possibility of just porting an application completely. In a generalized way, a simple Angular component could be transformed to an Angular Element with this steps: The first step is going to be install the library using our preferred packet manager: npm install @angular/elements yarn add @angular/elements Inside the app.module.ts, in addition to the normal declaration of the components inside declarations, the modules inside imports and the services inside providers, the components need to added in entryComponents. If there are components that have their own module, the same logic is going to be applied for them, only adding in the app.module.ts the components that do not have their own module. Here is an example of this: .... @NgModule({ declarations: [ DishFormComponent, DishViewComponent ], imports: [ CoreModule, // Module containing Angular Materials FormsModule ], entryComponents: [ DishFormComponent, DishViewComponent ], providers: [DishShareService] }) .... After that is done, the constructor of the module is going to be modified to use injector and bootstrap the application defining the components. This is going to allow the Angular Element to get the injections and to define a component tag that will be used later: .... }) export class AppModule { constructor(private injector: Injector) { } ngDoBootstrap() { const el = createCustomElement(DishFormComponent, {injector: this.injector}); customElements.define('dish-form', el); const elView = createCustomElement(DishViewComponent, {injector: this.injector}); customElements.define('dish-view', elView); } } .... In order to be able to use a component, @Input() and @Output() variables are used. These variables are going to be the ones that will allow the Angular Element to communicate with the framework/JavaScript: Component html {{ platename }} Submit Component ts @Component({ templateUrl: './dish-form.component.html', styleUrls: ['./dish-form.component.scss'] }) export class DishFormComponent implements OnInit { @Input() platename; @Input() platedescription; @Output() submitDishEvent = new EventEmitter(); submitted = false; dish = {name: '', description: ''}; constructor(public dishShareService: DishShareService) { } ngOnInit() { this.dish.name = this.platename; this.dish.description = this.platedescription; } onSubmit(dishForm: NgForm): void { this.dishShareService.createDish(dishForm.value.name, dishForm.value.description); this.submitDishEvent.emit('dishSubmited'); } } In this file there are definitions of multiple variables that will be used as input and output. Since the input variables are going to be used directly by html, only lowercase and underscore strategies can be used for them. On the onSubmit(dishForm: NgForm) a service is used to pass this variables to another component. Finally, as a last thing, the selector inside @Component has been removed since a tag that will be used dynamically was already defined in the last step. In order to be able to use this Angular Element a Polyfills/Browser support related error needs to solved. This error can be solved in two ways: One solution is to change the target in tsconfig.json to es2015. This might not be doable for every application since maybe a specific target is required. Another solution is to use AutoPollyfill. In order to do so, the library is going to be installed with a packet manager: Yarn yarn add @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs Npm npm install @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs After the packet manager has finished, inside the src folder a new file polyfills.ts is found. To solve the error, importing the corresponding adapter (custom-elements-es5-adapter.js) is necessary: .... /*************************************************************************************************** * APPLICATION IMPORTS */ import '@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js'; .... If you want to learn more about polyfills in angular you can do it here First, before building the Angular Element, every element inside that app component except the module need to be removed. After that, a bash script is created in the root folder,. This script will allow to put every necessary file into a JS. ng build \"projectName\" --configuration production --output-hashing=none && cat dist/\"projectName\"/runtime.js dist/\"projectName\"/polyfills.js dist/\"projectName\"/scripts.js dist/\"projectName\"/main.js > ./dist/\"projectName\"/\"nameWantedAngularElement\".js After executing the bash script, it will generate inside the path dist/\"projectName\" (or dist/apps/projectname in a Nx workspace) a JS file named \"nameWantedAngularElement\".js and a css file. The library ngx-build-plus allows to add different options when building. In addition, it solves some errors that will occur when trying to use multiple angular elements in an application. In order to use it, yarn or npm can be used: Yarn yarn add ngx-build-plus Npm npm install ngx-build-plus If you want to add it to a specific sub project in your projects folder, use the --project: .... ngx-build-plus --project \"project-name\" Using this library and the following command, an isolated Angular Element which won’t have conflict with others can be generated. This Angular Element will not have a polyfill so, the project where we use them will need to include a poliyfill with the Angular Element requirements. ng build \"projectName\" --output-hashing none --single-bundle true --configuration production --bundle-styles false This command will generate three things: The main JS bundle The script JS The css These files will be used later instead of the single JS generated in the last step. Here are some extra useful parameters that ngx-build-plus provides: --keep-polyfills: This parameter is going to allow us to keep the polyfills. This needs to be used with caution, avoiding using multiple different polyfills that could cause an error is necessary. --extraWebpackConfig webpack.extra.js: This parameter allows us to create a JavaScript file inside our Angular Elements project with the name of different libraries. Using webpack these libraries will not be included in the Angular Element. This is useful to lower the size of our Angular Element by removing libraries shared. Example: const webpack = require('webpack'); module.exports = { \"externals\": { \"rxjs\": \"rxjs\", \"@angular/core\": \"ng.core\", \"@angular/common\": \"ng.common\", \"@angular/common/http\": \"ng.common.http\", \"@angular/platform-browser\": \"ng.platformBrowser\", \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\": \"ng.platformBrowserDynamic\", \"@angular/compiler\": \"ng.compiler\", \"@angular/elements\": \"ng.elements\", \"@angular/router\": \"ng.router\", \"@angular/forms\": \"ng.forms\" } } If some libraries are excluded from the `Angular Element` you will need to add the bundled UMD files of those libraries manually. The Angular Element that got generated in the last step can be used in almost every framework. In this case, the Angular Element is going to be used in html: Sample index.html version without ngx-build-plus --> var elContainer = document.getElementById('container'); var el= document.createElement('dish-form'); el.setAttribute('platename','test'); el.setAttribute('platedescription','test'); el.addEventListener('submitDishEvent',(ev)=>{ var elView= document.createElement('dish-view'); elContainer.innerHTML = ''; elContainer.appendChild(elView); }); elContainer.appendChild(el); Sample index.html version with ngx-build-plus --> var elContainer = document.getElementById('container'); var el= document.createElement('dish-form'); el.setAttribute('platename','test'); el.setAttribute('platedescription','test'); el.addEventListener('submitDishEvent',(ev)=>{ var elView= document.createElement('dish-view'); elContainer.innerHTML = ''; elContainer.appendChild(elView); }); elContainer.appendChild(el); In this html, the css generated in the last step is going to be imported inside the and then, the JavaScript element is going to be imported at the end of the body. After that is done, There is two uses of Angular Elements in the html, one directly with use of the @input() variables as parameters commented in the html: .... --> .... and one dynamically inside the script: .... var elContainer = document.getElementById('container'); var el= document.createElement('dish-form'); el.setAttribute('platename','test'); el.setAttribute('platedescription','test'); el.addEventListener('submitDishEvent',(ev)=>{ var elView= document.createElement('dish-view'); elContainer.innerHTML = ''; elContainer.appendChild(elView); }); elContainer.appendChild(el); .... This JavaScript is an example of how to create dynamically an Angular Element inserting attributed to fill our @Input() variables and listen to the @Output() that was defined earlier. This is done with: el.addEventListener('submitDishEvent',(ev)=>{ var elView= document.createElement('dish-view'); elContainer.innerHTML = ''; elContainer.appendChild(elView); }); This allows JavaScript to hook with the @Output() event emitter that was defined. When this event gets called, another component that was defined gets inserted dynamically. In order to use an Angular Element within another Angular project the following steps need to be followed: First copy the generated .js and .css inside assets in the corresponding folder. Inside angular.json both of the files that were copied in the last step are going to be included. This will be done both, in test and in build. Including it on the test, will allow to perform unitary tests. { .... \"architect\": { .... \"build\": { .... \"styles\": [ .... \"src/assets/css/devon4ngAngularElements.css\" .... ] .... \"scripts\": [ \"src/assets/js/devon4ngAngularElements.js\" ] .... } .... \"test\": { .... \"styles\": [ .... \"src/assets/css/devon4ngAngularElements.css\" .... ] .... \"scripts\": [ \"src/assets/js/devon4ngAngularElements.js\" ] .... } } } By declaring the files in the angular.json angular will take care of including them in a proper way. If you are using Nx, the configuration file `angular.json` might be named as `workspace.json`, depending on how you had setup the workspace. The structure of the file remains similar though. There are two ways that Angular Element can be used: In order to add the component in a dynamic way, first adding a container is necessary: app.component.html .... .... With this container created, inside the app.component.ts a method is going to be created. This method is going to find the container, create the dynamic element and append it into the container. app.component.ts export class AppComponent implements OnInit { .... ngOnInit(): void { this.createComponent(); } .... createComponent(): void { const container = document.getElementById('container'); const component = document.createElement('dish-form'); container.appendChild(component); } .... In order to use it directly on the templates, in the app.module.ts the CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA needs to be added: .... import { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core'; .... @NgModule({ .... schemas: [ CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA ], This is going to allow the use of the Angular Element in the templates directly: app.component.html .... You can find a working example of Angular Elements in our devon4ts-samples repo by referring the samples named angular-elements and angular-elements-test.","title":"Angular Elements","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guide-angular-elements","url":"/typescript/current/angular/guide-angular-elements.html","titles":[{"text":"What are Angular Elements?","hash":"_what_are_angular_elements","id":1},{"text":"Why use Angular Elements?","hash":"_why_use_angular_elements","id":2},{"text":"Negative points about Elements","hash":"_negative_points_about_elements","id":3},{"text":"How to use Angular Elements?","hash":"_how_to_use_angular_elements","id":4},{"text":"Installing Angular Elements","hash":"_installing_angular_elements","id":5},{"text":"NPM","hash":"_npm","id":6},{"text":"YARN","hash":"_yarn","id":7},{"text":"Preparing the components in the modules","hash":"_preparing_the_components_in_the_modules","id":8},{"text":"A component example","hash":"_a_component_example","id":9},{"text":"Solving the error","hash":"_solving_the_error","id":10},{"text":"Changing the target","hash":"_changing_the_target","id":11},{"text":"Installing Polyfaces","hash":"_installing_polyfaces","id":12},{"text":"Building the Angular Element","hash":"_building_the_angular_element","id":13},{"text":"Building with ngx-build-plus (Recommended)","hash":"_building_with_ngx_build_plus_recommended","id":14},{"text":"Extra parameters","hash":"_extra_parameters","id":15},{"text":"Using the Angular Element","hash":"_using_the_angular_element","id":16},{"text":"Angular Element within another Angular project","hash":"_angular_element_within_another_angular_project","id":17},{"text":"Copy bundled script and css to resources","hash":"_copy_bundled_script_and_css_to_resources","id":18},{"text":"Add bundled script to angular.json","hash":"_add_bundled_script_to_angular_json","id":19},{"text":"Using Angular Element","hash":"_using_angular_element","id":20},{"text":"Create component dynamically","hash":"_create_component_dynamically","id":21},{"text":"Using it directly","hash":"_using_it_directly","id":22}]},"32":{"id":32,"text":"When the development of an application starts, it just contains a small set of features so the app usually loads fast. However, as new features are added, the overall application size grows up and its loading speed decreases. It is in this context where Lazy loading finds its place. Lazy loading is a design pattern that defers initialization of objects until it is needed, so, for example, users that just access to a website’s home page do not need to have other areas loaded. Angular handles lazy loading through the routing module which redirects to requested pages. Those pages can be loaded at start or on demand. To explain how lazy loading is implemented using angular, a basic sample app is going to be developed. This app will consist in a window named \"level 1\" that contains two buttons that redirects to other windows in a \"second level\". It is a simple example, but useful to understand the relation between angular modules and lazy loading. Figure 1. Levels app structure. This graphic shows that modules acts as gates to access components \"inside\" them. Because the objective of this guide is related mainly with logic, the html structure and SCSS styles are less relevant, but the complete code can be found as a sample here. First write in a console ng new level-app --routing, to generate a new project called level-app including an app-routing.module.ts file (--routing flag). If you are using Nx, the command would be nx generate @nrwl/angular:app level-app --routing in your Nx workspace. In the file app.component.html delete all the content except the router-outlet tag. File app.component.html The next steps consists on creating features modules. run ng generate module first --routing to generate a module named first. run ng generate module first/second-left --routing to generate a module named second-left under first. run ng generate module first/second-right --routing to generate a module second-right under first. run ng generate component first/first to generate a component named first inside the module first. run ng generate component first/second-left/content to generate a component content inside the module second-left. run ng generate component first/second-right/content to generate a component content inside the module second-right. If you are using Nx, you have to specify the project name (level-app) along with the --project flag. For example, command for generating the first module will be `ng generate module first --project=level-app --routing` To move between components we have to configure the routes used: In app-routing.module.ts add a path 'first' to FirstComponent and a redirection from '' to 'first'. File app-routing.module.ts. ... import { FirstComponent } from './first/first/first.component'; const routes: Routes = [ { path: 'first', component: FirstComponent }, { path: '', redirectTo: 'first', pathMatch: 'full', }, ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)], exports: [RouterModule], }) export class AppRoutingModule {} In app.module.ts import the module which includes FirstComponent. File app.module.ts .... import { FirstModule } from './first/first.module'; @NgModule({ ... imports: [ .... FirstModule ], ... }) export class AppModule { } In first-routing.module.ts add routes that direct to the content of SecondRightModule and SecondLeftModule. The content of both modules have the same name so, in order to avoid conflicts the name of the components are going to be changed using as ( original-name as new-name). File first-routing.module.ts ... import { ContentComponent as ContentLeft} from './second-left/content/content.component'; import { ContentComponent as ContentRight} from './second-right/content/content.component'; import { FirstComponent } from './first/first.component'; const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', component: FirstComponent }, { path: 'first/second-left', component: ContentLeft }, { path: 'first/second-right', component: ContentRight } ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)], exports: [RouterModule] }) export class FirstRoutingModule { } In first.module.ts import SecondLeftModule and SecondRightModule. File first.module.ts ... import { SecondLeftModule } from './second-left/second-left.module'; import { SecondRightModule } from './second-right/second-right.module'; @NgModule({ ... imports: [ ... SecondLeftModule, SecondRightModule, ] }) export class FirstModule { } Using the current configuration, we have a project that loads all the modules in a eager way. Run ng serve (with --project=level-app in an Nx workspace) to see what happens. First, during the compilation we can see that just a main file is built. Figure 2. Compile eager. If we go to http://localhost:4200/first and open developer options (F12 on Chrome), it is found that a document named \"first\" is loaded. Figure 3. First level eager. If we click on [Go to right module] a second level module opens, but there is no 'second-right' document. Figure 4. Second level right eager. But, typing the URL directly will load 'second-right' but no 'first', even if we click on [Go back] Figure 5. Second level right eager direct URL. Modifying an angular application to load its modules lazily is easy, you have to change the routing configuration of the desired module (for example FirstModule). File app-routing.module.ts. const routes: Routes = [ { path: 'first', loadChildren: () => import('./first/first.module').then(m => m.FirstModule), }, { path: '', redirectTo: 'first', pathMatch: 'full', }, ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)], exports: [RouterModule], }) export class AppRoutingModule {} Notice that instead of loading a component, you dynamically import it in a loadChildren attribute because modules acts as gates to access components \"inside\" them. Updating the app to load lazily has four consequences: No component attribute. No import of FirstComponent. FirstModule import has to be removed from the imports array at app.module.ts. Change of context. If we check first-routing.module.ts again, we can see that the path for ContentLeft and ContentRight is set to 'first/second-left' and 'first/second-right' respectively, so writing http://localhost:4200/first/second-left will redirect us to ContentLeft. However, after loading a module with loadChildren setting the path to 'second-left' and 'second-right' is enough because it acquires the context set by AppRoutingModule. File first-routing.module.ts const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', component: FirstComponent }, { path: 'second-left', component: ContentLeft }, { path: 'second-right', component: ContentRight } ]; If we go to 'first' then FirstModule is situated in '/first' but also its children ContentLeft and ContentRight, so it is not necessary to write in their path 'first/second-left' and 'first/second-right', because that will situate the components on 'first/first/second-left' and 'first/first/second-right'. Figure 6. First level lazy wrong path. When we compile an app with lazy loaded modules, files containing them will be generated Figure 7. First level lazy compilation. And if we go to developer tools → network, we can find those modules loaded (if they are needed). Figure 8. First level lazy. To load the component ContentComponent of SecondLeftModule lazily, we have to load SecondLeftModule as a children of FirstModule: Change component to loadChildren and reference SecondLeftModule. File first-routing.module.ts. const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', component: FirstComponent }, { path: 'second-left', loadChildren: () => import('./second-left/second-left.module').then(m => m.SecondLeftModule), }, { path: 'second-right', component: ContentRight } ]; Remove SecondLeftModule at first.component.ts Route the components inside SecondLeftModule. Without this step nothing would be displayed. File second-left-routing.module.ts. ... import { ContentComponent } from './content/content.component'; const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', component: ContentComponent } ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)], exports: [RouterModule] }) export class SecondLeftRoutingModule { } run ng serve to generate files containing the lazy modules. Figure 9. Second level lazy loading compilation. Clicking on [Go to left module] triggers the load of SecondLeftModule. Figure 10. Second level lazy loading network. Lazy loading is a pattern useful when new features are added, these features are usually identified as modules which can be loaded only if needed as shown in this document, reducing the time spent loading an application.","title":"Angular Lazy loading","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guide-angular-lazy-loading","url":"/typescript/current/angular/guide-angular-lazy-loading.html","titles":[{"text":"An example with Angular","hash":"_an_example_with_angular","id":1},{"text":"Implementation","hash":"_implementation","id":2},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"_conclusion","id":3}]},"33":{"id":33,"text":"We have listed some links to UI libraries and common requested feature components we recommend.

After that, using a packet manager (either npm or yarn) the library can be build and packed which will allow later to install/publish it. From wikipedia: a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications. In this section, a library is going to be build step by step. Please note, we will be explaining the steps using both Angular CLI and Nx CLI. You are free to choose either one for your development. First, using Angular CLI we are going to generate a empty application which will be later filled with the generated library. In order to do so, Angular CLI allows us to add to ng new \"application-name\" an option (--create-application). This option is going to tell Angular CLI not to create the initial app project. This is convenient since a library is going to be generated in later steps. Using this command ng new \"application-name\" --create-application=false an empty project with the name wanted is created. ng new \"application-name\" --create-application=false This step is much more easier and straight-forward when using Nx. Nx allows us to work in a monorepo workspace, where you can develop a project as an application, or a library, or a tool. You can follow this guide to get started with Nx. The command for generating a library in Nx is nx generate @nrwl/angular:library library-name --publishable --importPath=library-name. This will create an empty angular application which we can modify and publish as a library. After generating an empty application, a library is going to be generated. Inside the folder of the project, the Angular CLI command ng generate library \"library-name\" is going to generate the library as a project (projects/\"library-name\"). As an addition, the option --prefix=\"library-prefix-wanted\" allows us to switch the default prefix that Angular generated with (lib). Using the option to change the prefix the command will look like this ng generate library \"library-name\" --prefix=\"library-prefix-wanted\". ng generate library \"library-name\" --prefix=\"library-prefix-wanted\" If you are using Nx, this step is not needed as it is already covered in step 1. In this case, the library project will be generated in the libs folder of a Nx workspace. In the last step we generated a library. This automatically generates a module,service and a component inside projects/\"library-name\" that we can modify adding new methods, components etc that we want to use in other projects. We can generate other elements, using the usual Angular CLI generate commands adding the option --project=\"library-name\", this will allow to generate elements within our project . An example of this is: ng generate service \"name\" --project=\"library-name\". ng generate \"element\" \"name\" --project=\"library-name\" You can use the same command as above in a Nx workspace. Inside the library (projects/\"library-name) there’s a public_api.ts which is the file that exports the elements inside the library. (The file is named as index.ts in an Nx workspace). In case we generated other things, this file needs to be modified adding the extra exports with the generated elements. In addition, changing the library version is possible in the file package.json. Once we added the necessary exports, in order to use the library in other applications, we need to build the library. The command ng build \"library-name\" is going to build the library, generating the necessary files in \"project-name\"/dist/\"library-name\". ng build \"library-name\" You can use the same command in Nx as well. Only the path for the generated files will be slightly different: \"project-name\"/dist/libs/\"library-name\" In this step we are going to pack the build library. In order to do so, we need to go inside dist/\"library-name\" (or dist/libs/\"library-name\") and then run either npm pack or yarn pack to generate a \"library-name-version.tgz\" file. Packing using npm npm pack Packing using yarn yarn pack Add a README.md and LICENSE file. The text inside README.md will be used in you npm package web page as documentation. run npm adduser if you do not have a npm account to create it, otherwise run npm login and introduce your credentials. run npm publish inside dist/\"library-name\" folder. Check that the library is published: https://npmjs.com/package/library-name In this step we are going to install/add the library on other projects. In order to add the library in other applications, there are two ways: Option 1: From inside the application where the library is going to get used, using the command npm install \"path-to-tgz\"/\"library-name-version.tgz\" allows us to install the .tgz generated in Packing the library. Option 2: run npm install \"library-name\" to install it from npm repository. To add the package using yarn: Option 1: From inside the application where the library is going to get used, using the command yarn add \"path-to-tgz\"/\"library-name-version.tgz\" allows us to install the .tgz generated in Packing the library. Option 2: run yarn add \"library-name\" to install it from npm repository. Finally, once the library was installed with either packet manager, you can start using the elements from inside like they would be used in a normal element inside the application.

But wait, there’s no back-end. What can we do? Below you will find a solution that will get your started quick and easy. The idea is to write a simple mock service that helps us by feeding data into our components. Let’s say you have a simple boilerplate code, with your favorite styling library hooked up and you’re ready to go. The angular-material-basic-layout sample is a good starting place. Components - are the building blocks of our application. Their main role is to enable fragments of user interfaces. They will either display data (a list, a table, a chart, etc.), or 'collect' user interaction (e.g: a form, a menu, etc.) Components stay at the forefront of the application. They should also be reusable (as much as possible). Reusability is key for what we are trying to achieve - a stable, maintainable front-end where multiple people can contribute and collaborate. In our project, we are at the beginning. That means we may have more ideas than plans. We are exploring possibilities. In order to code efficiently: 1) We will not store mock data in the components. 2) We will not fetch or save data directly in the components. Learn more about Angular Components So, how do we get data in our app? How do we propagate the data to the components and how can we send user interaction from the components to the our data \"manager\" logic. The answer to all these questions is an Angular Service (that we will just call a service from now on). A service is an injectable logic that can be consumed by all the components that need it. It can carry manipulation functions and ,in our case, fetch data from a provider. Figure 1. Angular Components & Services architecture. Inside the Angular App, an Injector gives access to each component to their required services. It’s good coding practice to use a distinct service to each data type you want to manipulate. The type is described in a interface. Still, our ideas drive in different ways, so we have to stay flexible. We cannot use a database at the moment, but we want a way to represent data on screen, which can grow organically. Learn more about Angular Services Figure 2. Data box in relation to services and components. Let’s consider a 'box of data' represented in JSON. Physically, this means a folder with some JSON/TS files in it. They are located in the app/mock folder. The example uses only one mock data file. The file is typed according to our data model. Pro tip: separate your files based on purpose. In your source code, put the mock files in the mock folder, components in the components folder, services in the services folder and data models in the models folder. Figure 3. Project structure. Aligned with the Angular way of development, we are implementing a model-view-controller pattern. The model is represented by the interfaces we make. These interfaces describe the data structures we will use in our application. In this example, there is one data model, corresponding with the 'type' of data that was mocked. In the models folder you will find the .ts script file that describes chemical elements. The corresponding mock file defines a set is chemical elements objects, in accordance to our interface definition. Enough with the theory, let’s see what we have here. The app presents 3 pages as follows: A leader board with the top 3 elements A data table with all the elements A details page that reads a route parameter and displays the details of the element. There are a lot of business cases which have these requirements: A leader board can be understood as \"the most popular items in a set\", \"the latest updated items\", \"you favorite items\" etc. A data table with CRUD operations is very useful (in our case we only view details or delete an item, but they illustrate two important things: the details view shows how to navigate and consume a parametric route, the delete action shows how to invoke service operations over the loaded data - this means that the component is reusable and when the data comes with and API, only the service will need it’s implementation changed) Check out the angular-mock-service sample from the apps folder and easily get started with front-end development using dummy data.","title":"Angular Mock Service","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guide-angular-mock-service","url":"/typescript/current/angular/guide-angular-mock-service.html","titles":[{"text":"The app we start with","hash":"_the_app_we_start_with","id":1},{"text":"The Components","hash":"_the_components","id":2},{"text":"The Service","hash":"_the_service","id":3},{"text":"The Model","hash":"_the_model","id":4},{"text":"Use case","hash":"_use_case","id":5}]},"36":{"id":36,"text":"Progressive web applications (PWA) are web application that offer better user experience than the traditional ones. In general, they solve problems related with reliability and speed: Reliability: PWA are stable. In this context stability means than even with slow connections or even with no network at all, the application still works. To achieve this, some basic resources like styles, fonts, requests, …​ are stored; due to this caching, it is not possible to assure that the content is always up-to-date. Speed: When an users opens an application, he or she will expect it to load almost immediately (almost 53% of users abandon sites that take longer that 3 seconds, source: https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/#fast). PWA uses a script called service worker, which runs in background and essentially act as proxy between web app and network, intercepting requests and acting depending on the network conditions. This guide assumes that you already have installed: NodeJS npm package manager Angular CLI / Nx CLI Figure 1. Basic angular PWA. To explain how to build PWA using angular, a basic application is going to be built. This app will be able to ask for resources and save in the cache in order to work even offline. This step can be completed with one simple command using the Angular CLI: ng new , where is the name for the app. In this case, the app is going to be named basic-ng-pwa. If you are using Nx CLI, you can use the command nx generate @nrwl/angular:app in your Nx workspace. You can follow this guide if you want to get started with Nx workspace. Web applications usually uses external resources, making necessary the addition of services which can get those resources. This application gets a dish from My Thai Star’s back-end and shows it. To do so, a new service is going to be created. go to project folder: cd basic-ng-pwa. If using Nx, go to the root folder of the workspace. run ng generate service data. For Nx CLI, specify the project name with --project flag. So the command becomes ng generate service data --project=basic-ng-pwa Modify data.service.ts, environment.ts, environment.prod.ts To retrieve data with this service, you have to import the module HttpClient and add it to the service’s constructor. Once added, use it to create a function getDishes() that sends HTTP request to My Thai Start’s back-end. The URL of the back-end can be stored as an environment variable MY_THAI_STAR_DISH. data.service.ts ... import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; import { MY_THAI_STAR_DISH } from '../environments/environment'; ... export class DataService { constructor(private http: HttpClient) {} /* Get data from Back-end */ getDishes() { return this.http.get(MY_THAI_STAR_DISH); } ... } environments.ts ... export const MY_THAI_STAR_DISH = 'https://mts-devonfw-core.cloud.okteto.net/api/services/rest/dishmanagement/v1/dish/1'; ... environments.prod.ts ... export const MY_THAI_STAR_DISH = 'https://mts-devonfw-core.cloud.okteto.net/api/services/rest/dishmanagement/v1/dish/1'; ... The component AppComponent implements the interface OnInit and inside its method ngOnInit() the subscription to the services is done. When a dish arrives, it is saved and shown (app.component.html). ... import { DataService } from './data.service'; export class AppComponent implements OnInit { dish: { name: string; description: string } = { name: '', description: ''}; ... ngOnInit() { this.data .getDishes() .subscribe( (dishToday: { dish: { name: string; description: string } }) => { this.dish = { name: dishToday.dish.name, description: dishToday.dish.description, }; }, ); } } This step shows code interesting inside the sample app. The complete content can be found in devon4ts-samples. index.html To use the Montserrat font add the following link inside the head tag of the app’s index.html file. styles.scss body { ... font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; } app.component.ts This file is also used to reload the app if there are any changes. SwUpdate: This object comes inside the @angular/pwa package and it is used to detect changes and reload the page if needed. ... import { SwUpdate } from '@angular/service-worker'; export class AppComponent implements OnInit { ... constructor(updates: SwUpdate, private data: DataService) { updates.available.subscribe((event) => { updates.activateUpdate().then(() => document.location.reload()); }); } ... } Install Angular PWA package with ng add @angular/pwa --project=. As before substitute name with basic-ng-pwa. The above command completes the following actions: Adds the @angular/service-worker package to your project. Enables service worker build support in the CLI. Imports and registers the service worker in the app module. Updates the index.html file: Includes a link to add the manifest.json file. Adds meta tags for theme-color. Installs icon files to support the installed Progressive Web App (PWA). Creates the service worker configuration file called ngsw-config.json, which specifies the caching behaviors and other settings. manifest.json is a file that allows to control how the app is displayed in places where native apps are displayed. Fields name: Name of the web application. short_name: Short version of name. theme_color: Default theme color for an application context. background_color: Expected background color of the web application. display: Preferred display mode. scope: Navigation scope of this web application’s application context. start_url: URL loaded when the user launches the web application. icons: Array of icons that serve as representations of the web app. Additional information can be found here. ngsw-config.json specifies which files and data URLs have to be cached and updated by the Angular service worker. Fields index: File that serves as index page to satisfy navigation requests. assetGroups: Resources that are part of the app version that update along with the app. name: Identifies the group. installMode: How the resources are cached (pre-fetch or lazy). updateMode: Caching behavior when a new version of the app is found (pre-fetch or lazy). resources: Resources to cache. There are three groups. files: Lists patterns that match files in the distribution directory. urls: URL patterns matched at runtime. dataGroups: UsefulIdentifies the group. for API requests. name: Identifies the group. urls: URL patterns matched at runtime. version: Indicates that the resources being cached have been updated in a backwards-incompatible way. cacheConfig: Policy by which matching requests will be cached maxSize: The maximum number of entries, or responses, in the cache. maxAge: How long responses are allowed to remain in the cache. d: days. (5d = 5 days). h: hours m: minutes s: seconds. (5m20s = 5 minutes and 20 seconds). u: milliseconds timeout: How long the Angular service worker will wait for the network to respond before using a cached response.

Run in the project’s root folder the commands below: ng build --prod to build the app using production settings.(nx build --prod in Nx CLI) npm install http-server to install an npm module that can serve your built application. Documentation here. Go to the dist/basic-ng-pwa/ folder running cd dist/basic-ng-pwa. In an Nx workspace, the path will be dist/apps/basic-ng-pwa http-server -o to serve your built app. Figure 2. Http server running on localhost:8081. In another console instance run ng serve (or nx serve basic-ng-pwa for Nx) to open the common app (not built). Figure 3. Angular server running on localhost:4200. The first difference can be found on Developer tools → application, here it is seen that the PWA application (left) has a service worker and the common (right) one does not. Figure 4. Application service worker comparison. If the \"offline\" box is checked, it will force a disconnection from network. In situations where users do not have connectivity or have a slow, one the PWA can still be accessed and used. Figure 5. Offline application. Finally, browser extensions like Lighthouse can be used to test whether an application is progressive or not. Figure 6.

Colors and its light and dark variants conform a palette. In general, a theme consists of the following palettes: primary: Most used across screens and components. accent: Floating action button and interactive elements. warn: Error state. foreground: Text and icons. background: Element backgrounds. Figure 1. Palettes and variants. In angular material, a palette is represented as a SCSS map. Figure 2. SCSS map and palettes. Some components can be forced to use primary, accent or warn palettes using the attribute color, for example: . Available pre-built themes: deeppurple-amber.css Figure 3. deeppurple-amber theme. indigo-pink.css Figure 4. indigo-pink theme. pink-bluegrey.css Figure 5. ink-bluegrey theme. purple-green.css Figure 6. purple-green theme. The pre-built themes can be added using @import. @import '@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/deeppurple-amber.css'; Sometimes pre-built themes do not meet the needs of a project, because color schemas are too specific or do not incorporate branding colors, in those situations custom themes can be built to offer a better solution to the client. For this topic, we are going to use a basic layout project that can be found in devon4ts-samples repository. Before starting writing custom themes, there are some necessary things that have to be mentioned: Add a default theme: The project mentioned before has just one global SCSS style sheet styles.scss that includes indigo-pink.scss which will be the default theme. Add @import '~@angular/material/theming'; at the beginning of the every style sheet to be able to use angular material pre-built color palettes and functions. Add @include mat-core(); once per project, so if you are writing multiple themes in multiple files you could import those files from a 'central' one (for example styles.scss). This includes all common styles that are used by multiple components. Figure 7. Theme files structure. To create a new custom theme, the .scss file containing it has to have imported the angular _theming.scss file (angular/material/theming) file and mat-core included. _theming.scss includes multiple color palettes and some functions that we are going to see below. The file for this basic theme is going to be named styles-custom-dark.scss. First, declare new variables for primary, accent and warn palettes. Those variables are going to store the result of the function mat-palette. mat-palette accepts four arguments: base color palette, main, lighter and darker variants (See Palettes and variants.) and returns a new palette including some additional map values: default, lighter and darker ([id_scss_map]). Only the first argument is mandatory. File styles-custom-dark.scss. $custom-dark-theme-primary: mat-palette($mat-pink); $custom-dark-theme-accent: mat-palette($mat-blue); $custom-dark-theme-warn: mat-palette($mat-red); ); In this example we are using colors available in _theming.scss: mat-pink, mat-blue, mat-red. If you want to use a custom color you need to define a new map, for instance: File styles-custom-dark.scss custom pink. $my-pink: ( 50 : #fcf3f3, 100 : #f9e0e0, 200 : #f5cccc, 300 : #f0b8b8, 500 : #ea9999, 900 : #db6b6b, A100 : #ffffff, A200 : #ffffff, A400 : #ffeaea, A700 : #ffd0d0, contrast: ( 50 : #000000, 100 : #000000, 200 : #000000, 300 : #000000, 900 : #000000, A100 : #000000, A200 : #000000, A400 : #000000, A700 : #000000, ) ); $custom-dark-theme-primary: mat-palette($my-pink); ... Some pages allows to create these palettes easily, for instance: http://mcg.mbitson.com Until now, we just have defined primary, accent and warn palettes but what about foreground and background? Angular material has two functions to change both: mat-light-theme: Receives as arguments primary, accent and warn palettes and return a theme whose foreground is basically black (texts, icons, …​), the background is white and the other palettes are the received ones. Figure 8. Custom light theme. mat-dark-theme: Similar to mat-light-theme but returns a theme whose foreground is basically white and background black. Figure 9. Custom dark theme. For this example we are going to use mat-dark-theme and save its result in $custom-dark-theme. File styles-custom-dark.scss updated with mat-dark-theme. ... $custom-dark-theme: mat-dark-theme( $custom-dark-theme-primary, $custom-dark-theme-accent, $custom-dark-theme-warn ); To apply the saved theme, we have to go to styles.scss and import our styles-custom-dark.scss and include a function called angular-material-theme using the theme variable as argument. File styles.scss. ... @import 'styles-custom-dark.scss'; @include angular-material-theme($custom-dark-theme); If we have multiple themes it is necessary to add the include statement inside a css class and use it in src/index.html → app-root component. File styles.scss updated with custom-dark-theme class. ... @import 'styles-custom-dark.scss'; .custom-dark-theme { @include angular-material-theme($custom-dark-theme); } File src/index.html. ... ... This will apply $custom-dark-theme theme for the entire application. Sometimes it is needed to custom different elements from background and foreground, in those situations we have to create a new function similar to mat-light-theme and mat-dark-theme. Let’s focus con mat-light-theme: Source code of mat-light-theme @function mat-light-theme($primary, $accent, $warn: mat-palette($mat-red)) { @return ( primary: $primary, accent: $accent, warn: $warn, is-dark: false, foreground: $mat-light-theme-foreground, background: $mat-light-theme-background, ); } As we can see, mat-light-theme takes three arguments and returns a map including them as primary, accent and warn color; but there are three more keys in that map: is-dark, foreground and background. is-dark: Boolean true if it is a dark theme, false otherwise. background: Map that stores the color for multiple background elements. foreground: Map that stores the color for multiple foreground elements. To show which elements can be colored lets create a new theme in a file styles-custom-cap.scss: File styles-custom-cap.scss: Background and foreground variables. @import '~@angular/material/theming'; // custom background and foreground palettes $my-cap-theme-background: ( status-bar: #0070ad, app-bar: map_get($mat-blue, 900), background: #12abdb, hover: rgba(white, 0.04), card: map_get($mat-red, 800), dialog: map_get($mat-grey, 800), disabled-button: $white-12-opacity, raised-button: map-get($mat-grey, 800), focused-button: $white-6-opacity, selected-button: map_get($mat-grey, 900), selected-disabled-button: map_get($mat-grey, 800), disabled-button-toggle: black, unselected-chip: map_get($mat-grey, 700), disabled-list-option: black, ); $my-cap-theme-foreground: ( base: yellow, divider: $white-12-opacity, dividers: $white-12-opacity, disabled: rgba(white, 0.3), disabled-button: rgba(white, 0.3), disabled-text: rgba(white, 0.3), hint-text: rgba(white, 0.3), secondary-text: rgba(white, 0.7), icon: white, icons: white, text: white, slider-min: white, slider-off: rgba(white, 0.3), slider-off-active: rgba(white, 0.3), ); Function which uses the variables defined before to create a new theme: File styles-custom-cap.scss: Creating a new theme function. // instead of creating a theme with mat-light-theme or mat-dark-theme, // we will create our own theme-creating function that lets us apply our own foreground and background palettes. @function create-my-cap-theme($primary, $accent, $warn: mat-palette($mat-red)) { @return ( primary: $primary, accent: $accent, warn: $warn, is-dark: false, foreground: $my-cap-theme-foreground, background: $my-cap-theme-background ); } Calling the new function and storing its value in $custom-cap-theme. File styles-custom-cap.scss: Storing the new theme. // We use create-my-cap-theme instead of mat-light-theme or mat-dark-theme $custom-cap-theme-primary: mat-palette($mat-green); $custom-cap-theme-accent: mat-palette($mat-blue); $custom-cap-theme-warn: mat-palette($mat-red); $custom-cap-theme: create-my-cap-theme( $custom-cap-theme-primary, $custom-cap-theme-accent, $custom-cap-theme-warn ); After defining our new theme, we can import it from styles.scss. File styles.scss updated with custom-cap-theme class. ... @import 'styles-custom-cap.scss'; .custom-cap-theme { @include angular-material-theme($custom-cap-theme); } Certain components (e.g. menu, select, dialog, etc.) that are inside of a global overlay container,require an additional step to be affected by the theme’s css class selector.

This provides benefits since this is done on runtime, so there’s no need to recompile the whole application to switch from configuration. APP_INITIALIZER allows to provide a service in the initialization of the application in a @NgModule. It also allows to use a factory, allowing to create a singleton in the same service. An example can be found in MyThaiStar /core/config/config.module.ts: The provider expects the return of a Promise, if it is using Observables, a change with the method toPromise() will allow a switch from Observable to Promise import { NgModule, APP_INITIALIZER } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'; import { ConfigService } from './config.service'; @NgModule({ imports: [HttpClientModule], providers: [ ConfigService, { provide: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: ConfigService.factory, deps: [ConfigService], multi: true, }, ], }) export class ConfigModule {} This is going to allow the creation of a ConfigService where, using a singleton, the service is going to load an external config depending on a route. This dependence with a route, allows to setup different configuration for docker etc. This is seen in the ConfigService of MyThaiStar: import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; import { Config, config } from './config'; @Injectable() export class ConfigService { constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {} static factory(appLoadService: ConfigService) { return () => appLoadService.loadExternalConfig(); } // this method gets external configuration calling /config endpoint //and merges into config object loadExternalConfig(): Promise { if (!environment.loadExternalConfig) { return Promise.resolve({}); } const promise = this.httpClient .get('/config') .toPromise() .then((settings) => { Object.keys(settings || {}).forEach((k) => { config[k] = settings[k]; }); return settings; }) .catch((error) => { return 'ok, no external configuration'; }); return promise; } getValues(): Config { return config; } } As it is mentioned earlier, you can see the use of a factory to create a singleton at the start. After that, loadExternalConfig is going to look for a Boolean inside the corresponding environment file inside the path src/environments/, this Boolean loadExternalConfig is going to easily allow to switch to a external config. If it is true, it generates a promise that overwrites the parameters of the local config, allowing to load the external config. Finally, the last method getValues() is going to allow to return the file config with the values (overwritten or not). The local config file from MyThaiStar can be seen here: export enum BackendType { IN_MEMORY, REST, GRAPHQL, } interface Role { name: string; permission: number; } interface Lang { label: string; value: string; } export interface Config { version: string; backendType: BackendType; restPathRoot: string; restServiceRoot: string; pageSizes: number[]; pageSizesDialog: number[]; roles: Role[]; langs: Lang[]; } export const config: Config = { version: 'dev', backendType: BackendType.REST, restPathRoot: 'http://localhost:8081/mythaistar/', restServiceRoot: 'http://localhost:8081/mythaistar/services/rest/', pageSizes: [8, 16, 24], pageSizesDialog: [4, 8, 12], roles: [ { name: 'CUSTOMER', permission: 0 }, { name: 'WAITER', permission: 1 }, ], langs: [ { label: 'English', value: 'en' }, { label: 'Deutsch', value: 'de' }, { label: 'Español', value: 'es' }, { label: 'Català', value: 'ca' }, { label: 'Français', value: 'fr' }, { label: 'Nederlands', value: 'nl' }, { label: 'हिन्दी', value: 'hi' }, { label: 'Polski', value: 'pl' }, { label: 'Русский', value: 'ru' }, { label: 'български', value: 'bg' }, ], }; Finally, inside a environment file src/environments/environment.ts the use of the Boolean loadExternalConfig is seen: // The file contents for the current environment will overwrite these during build. // The build system defaults to the dev environment which uses `environment.ts`, but if you do // `ng build --env=prod` then `environment.prod.ts` will be used instead. // The list of which env maps to which file can be found in `.angular-cli.json`. export const environment: { production: boolean; loadExternalConfig: boolean; } = { production: false, loadExternalConfig: false }; This section is going to be used to create a new APP_INITIALIZER basic example. For this, a basic app with angular is going to be generated using ng new \"appname\" substituting appname for the name of the app opted. If you are using Nx, the command would be nx generate @nrwl/angular:app \"appname\" in your Nx workspace. Click here to get started with using Nx. This section is only done if there is a docker configuration in the app you are setting up this type of configuration. 1.- Create in the root folder /docker-external-config.json. This external config is going to be used when the application is loaded with docker (if the Boolean to load the external configuration is set to true). Here you need to add all the config parameter you want to load with docker: { \"version\": \"docker-version\" } 2.- In the root, in the file /Dockerfile angular is going to copy the docker-external-config.json that was created before into the Nginx html route: .... COPY docker-external-config.json /usr/share/nginx/html/docker-external-config.json .... 1.- Create a json file in the route /src/external-config.json. This external config is going to be used when the application is loaded with the start script (if the Boolean to load the external configuration is set to true). Here you need to add all the config parameter you want to load: { \"version\": \"external-config\" } 2.- The file named /angular.json (/workspace.json if using Nx) located at the root is going to be modified to add the file external-config.json that was just created to both \"assets\" inside Build and Test: .... \"build\": { .... \"assets\": [ \"src/assets\", \"src/data\", \"src/favicon.ico\", \"src/manifest.json\", \"src/external-config.json\" ] .... \"test\": { .... \"assets\": [ \"src/assets\", \"src/data\", \"src/favicon.ico\", \"src/manifest.json\", \"src/external-config.json\" ] .... This step is going to setup two proxies. This is going to allow to load the config desired by the context, in case that it is using docker to load the app or in case it loads the app with angular. Loading different files is made possible by the fact that the ConfigService method loadExternalConfig() looks for the path /config. 1.- This step is going to be for docker. Add docker-external-config.json to Nginx configuration (/nginx.conf) that is in the root of the application: .... location ~ ^/config { alias /usr/share/nginx/html/docker-external-config.json; } .... 1.- Now the file /proxy.conf.json, needs to be created/modified this file can be found in the root of the application. In this file you can add the route of the external configuration in target and the name of the file in ^/config:: .... \"/config\": { \"target\": \"http://localhost:4200\", \"secure\": false, \"pathRewrite\": { \"^/config\": \"/external-config.json\" } } .... 2.- The file package.json found in the root of the application is gonna use the start script to load the proxy config that was just created : \"scripts\": { .... \"start\": \"ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json -o\", .... If using Nx, you need to run the command manually: nx run angular-app-initializer:serve:development --proxyConfig=proxy.conf.json --o In order to load an external config we need to add the loadExternalConfig Boolean to the environments. To do so, inside the folder environments/ the files are going to get modified adding this Boolean to each environment that is going to be used. In this case, only two environments are going to be modified (environment.ts and environment.prod.ts). Down below there is an example of the modification being done in the environment.prod.ts: export const environment: { production: boolean; loadExternalConfig: boolean; } = { production: false, loadExternalConfig: false }; In the file in first instance there is the declaration of the types of the variables. After that, there is the definition of those variables. This variable loadExternalConfig is going to be used by the service, allowing to setup a external config just by switching the loadExternalConfig to true. In order to create the whole configuration module three are going to be created: 1.- Create in the core app/core/config/ a config.ts export interface Config { version: string; } export const config: Config = { version: 'dev' }; Taking a look to this file, it creates a interface (Config) that is going to be used by the variable that exports (export const config: Config). This variable config is going to be used by the service that is going to be created. 2.- Create in the core app/core/config/ a config.service.ts: import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; import { Config, config } from './config'; @Injectable() export class ConfigService { constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) {} static factory(appLoadService: ConfigService) { return () => appLoadService.loadExternalConfig(); } // this method gets external configuration calling /config endpoint // and merges into config object loadExternalConfig(): Promise { if (!environment.loadExternalConfig) { return Promise.resolve({}); } const promise = this.httpClient .get('/config') .toPromise() .then((settings) => { Object.keys(settings || {}).forEach((k) => { config[k] = settings[k]; }); return settings; }) .catch((error) => { return 'ok, no external configuration'; }); return promise; } getValues(): Config { return config; } } As it was explained in previous steps, at first, there is a factory that uses the method loadExternalConfig(), this factory is going to be used in later steps in the module. After that, the loadExternalConfig() method checks if the Boolean in the environment is false. If it is false it will return the promise resolved with the normal config. Else, it is going to load the external config in the path (/config), and overwrite the values from the external config to the config that’s going to be used by the app, this is all returned in a promise. 3.- Create in the core a module for the config app/core/config/ a config.module.ts: import { NgModule, APP_INITIALIZER } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'; import { ConfigService } from './config.service'; @NgModule({ imports: [HttpClientModule], providers: [ ConfigService, { provide: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: ConfigService.factory, deps: [ConfigService], multi: true, }, ], }) export class ConfigModule {} As seen earlier, the ConfigService is added to the module. In this addition, the app is initialized(provide) and it uses the factory that was created in the ConfigService loading the config with or without the external values depending on the Boolean in the config. As a first step, in the file /app/app.module.ts the ConfigModule created earlier in the other step is going to be imported: imports: [ .... ConfigModule, .... ] After that, the ConfigService is going to be injected into the app.component.ts .... import { ConfigService } from './core/config/config.service'; .... export class AppComponent { .... constructor(public configService: ConfigService) { } .... Finally, for this demonstration app, the component app/app.component.html is going to show the version of the config it is using at that moment. Welcome to {{ title }}! Here is the configuration version that is using angular right now: {{configService.getValues().version}} The script start that was created earlier in the package.json (npm start) is going to be used to start the application. After that, modifying the Boolean loadExternalConfig inside the corresponding environment file inside /app/environments/ should show the different config versions.","title":"APP_INITIALIZER","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guide-app-initializer","url":"/typescript/current/angular/guide-app-initializer.html","titles":[{"text":"What is the APP_INITIALIZER pattern","hash":"_what_is_the_app_initializer_pattern","id":1},{"text":"What is APP_INITIALIZER","hash":"_what_is_app_initializer","id":2},{"text":"Creating a APP_INITIALIZER configuration","hash":"_creating_a_app_initializer_configuration","id":3},{"text":"Setting up the config files","hash":"_setting_up_the_config_files","id":4},{"text":"Docker external configuration (Optional)","hash":"_docker_external_configuration_optional","id":5},{"text":"External json configuration","hash":"_external_json_configuration","id":6},{"text":"Setting up the proxies","hash":"_setting_up_the_proxies","id":7},{"text":"Docker (Optional)","hash":"_docker_optional","id":8},{"text":"External Configuration","hash":"_external_configuration","id":9},{"text":"Adding the loadExternalConfig Boolean to the environments","hash":"_adding_the_loadexternalconfig_boolean_to_the_environments","id":10},{"text":"Creating core configuration service","hash":"_creating_core_configuration_service","id":11},{"text":"Using the Config Service","hash":"_using_the_config_service","id":12},{"text":"Final steps","hash":"_final_steps","id":13}]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"When implementing a new requirement there are a few design decisions, which need to be considered. A decomposition in Smart and Dumb Components should be done first. This includes the definition of state and responsibilities. Implementing a new dialog will most likely be done by defining a new Smart Component with multiple Dumb Component children. In the component tree this would translate to the definition of a new sub-tree. Figure 1. Component Tree with highlighted sub-tree The following gives an example for component decomposition. Shown is a screenshot from a style guide to be implemented. It is a widget called Listpicker. The basic function is an input field accepting direct input. So typing otto puts otto inside the FormControl. With arrow down key or by clicking the icon displayed in the inputs right edge a dropdown is opened. Inside possible values can be selected and filtered beforehand. After pressing arrow down key the focus should move into the filter input field. Up and down arrow keys can be used to select an element from the list. Typing into the filter input field filters the list from which the elements can be selected. The current selected element is highlighted with green background color. Figure 2. Component decomposition example before What should be done, is to define small reusable Dumb Components. This way the complexity becomes manageable. In the example every colored box describes a component with the purple box being a Smart Component. Figure 3. Component decomposition example after This leads to the following component tree. Figure 4. Component decomposition example component tree Note the uppermost component is a Dumb Component. It is a wrapper for the label and the component to be displayed inside a form. The Smart Component is Listpicker. This way the widget can be reused without a form needed. A widgets is a typical Smart Component to be shared across feature modules. So the SharedModule is the place for it to be defined. Every UI has state. There are different kinds of state, for example View State: e.g. is a panel open, a css transition pending, etc. Application State: e.g. is a payment pending, current URL, user info, etc. Business Data: e.g. products loaded from back-end It is good practice to base the component decomposition on the state handled by a component and to define a simplified state model beforehand. Starting with the parent - the Smart Component: What overall state does the dialog have: e.g. loading, error, valid data loaded, valid input, invalid input, etc. Every defined value should correspond to an overall appearance of the whole dialog. What events can occur to the dialog: e.g. submitting a form, changing a filter, pressing buttons, pressing keys, etc. For every Dumb Component: What data does a component display: e.g. a header text, user information to be displayed, a loading flag, etc. This will be a slice of the overall state of the parent Smart Component. In general a Dumb Component presents a slice of its parent Smart Components state to the user. What events can occur: keyboard events, mouse events, etc. These events are all handled by its parent Smart Component - every event is passed up the tree to be handled by a Smart Component. These information should be reflected inside the modeled state. The implementation is a TypeScript type - an interface or a class describing the model. So there should be a type describing all state relevant for a Smart Component. An instance of that type is send down the component tree at runtime. Not every Dumb Component will need the whole state. For instance a single Dumb Component could only need a single string. The state model for the previous Listpicker example is shown in the following listing. Listpicker state model export class ListpickerState { items: {}[]|undefined; columns = ['key', 'value']; keyColumn = 'key'; displayValueColumn = 'value'; filteredItems: {}[]|undefined; filter = ''; placeholder = ''; caseSensitive = true; isDisabled = false; isDropdownOpen = false; selectedItem: {}|undefined; displayValue = ''; } Listpicker holds an instance of ListpickerState which is passed down the component tree via @Input() bindings in the Dumb Components. Events emitted by children - Dumb Components - create a new instance of ListpickerState based on the current instance and the event and its data. So a state transition is just setting a new instance of ListpickerState. Angular Bindings propagate the value down the tree after exchanging the state. Listpicker State transition export class ListpickerComponent { // initial default values are set state = new ListpickerState(); /** User changes filter */ onFilterChange(filter: string): void { // apply filter ... const filteredList = this.filterService.filter(...); // important: A new instance is created, instead of altering the existing one. // This makes change detection easier and prevents hard to find bugs. this.state = Object.assing({}, this.state, { filteredItems: filteredList, filter: filter }); } } Note: It is not always necessary to define the model as independent type. So there would be no state property and just properties for every state defined directly in the component class. When complexity grows and state becomes larger this is usually a good idea. If the state should be shared between Smart Components a store is to be used. Sometimes it is not necessary to perform a full decomposition. The architecture does not enforce it generally. What you should keep in mind is, that there is always a point when it becomes recommendable. For example a template with 800 line of code is: not understandable not maintainable not testable not reusable So when implementing a template with more than 50 line of code you should think about decomposition.","title":"Component Decomposition","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guide-component-decomposition","url":"/typescript/current/angular/guide-component-decomposition.html","titles":[{"text":"Defining Components","hash":"_defining_components","id":1},{"text":"Defining state","hash":"_defining_state","id":2},{"text":"When are Dumb Components needed","hash":"_when_are_dumb_components_needed","id":3}]},"40":{"id":40,"text":"A good introduction to working with Angular HttpClient can be found in Angular Docs This guide will cover, how to embed Angular HttpClient in the application architecture. For back-end request a special service with the suffix Adapter needs to be defined. It is a good practice to have a Angular service whose single responsibility is to call the back-end and parse the received value to a transfer data model (e.g. Swagger generated TOs). Those services need to have the suffix Adapter to make them easy to recognize. Figure 1. Adapters handle back-end communication As illustrated in the figure a Use Case service does not use Angular HttpClient directly but uses an adapter. A basic adapter could look like this: Example adapter import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable'; import { FlightTo } from './flight-to'; @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root', }) export class FlightsAdapter { constructor( private httpClient: HttpClient ) {} getFlights(): Observable { return this.httpClient.get('/relative/url/to/flights'); } } The adapters should use a well-defined transfer data model. This could be generated from server endpoints with CobiGen, Swagger, typescript-maven-plugin, etc. If inside the application there is a business model defined, the adapter has to parse to the transfer model. This is illustrated in the following listing. Example adapter mapping from business model to transfer model import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable'; import { map } from 'rxjs/operators'; import { FlightTo } from './flight-to'; import { Flight } from '../../../model/flight'; @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root', }) export class FlightsAdapter { constructor( private httpClient: HttpClient ) {} updateFlight(flight: Flight): Observable { const to = this.mapFlight(flight); return this.httpClient.post('/relative/url/to/flights', to).pipe( map(to => this.mapFlightTo(to)) ); } private mapFlight(flight: Flight): FlightTo { // mapping logic } private mapFlightTo(flightTo: FlightTo): Flight { // mapping logic } } In most cases the access to back-end API is secured using well known mechanisms as CSRF, JWT or both. In these cases the front-end application must manage the tokens that are generated when the user authenticates. More concretely it must store them to include them in every request automatically. Obviously, when user logs out these tokens must be removed from localStorage, memory, etc. In order to make this guide simple we are going to store the token in memory. Therefore, if we consider that we already have a login mechanism implemented we would like to store the token using a auth.service.ts: import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { Router } from '@angular/router'; @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root', }) export class AuthService { private loggedIn = false; private token: string; constructor(public router: Router) {} public isLogged(): boolean { return this.loggedIn || false; } public setLogged(login: boolean): void { this.loggedIn = login; } public getToken(): string { return this.token; } public setToken(token: string): void { this.token = token; } } Using the previous service we will be able to store the token obtained in the login request using the method setToken(token). Please consider that, if you want a more sophisticated approach using localStorage API, you will need to modify this service accordingly. Now that the token is available in the application it is necessary to include it in every request to a protected API endpoint. Instead of modifying all the HTTP requests in our application, Angular provides a class to intercept every request (and every response if we need to) called HttpInterceptor. Let’s create a service called http-interceptor.service.ts to implement the intercept method of this class: import { HttpEvent, HttpHandler, HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, } from '@angular/common/http'; import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { Observable } from 'rxjs'; import { environment } from '../../../environments/environment'; import { AuthService } from './auth.service'; @Injectable() export class HttpRequestInterceptorService implements HttpInterceptor { constructor(private auth: AuthService) {} intercept( req: HttpRequest, next: HttpHandler, ): Observable> { // Get the auth header from the service. const authHeader: string = this.auth.getToken(); if (authHeader) { let authReq: HttpRequest; // CSRF if (environment.security === 'csrf') { authReq = req.clone({ withCredentials: true, setHeaders: { 'x-csrf-token': authHeader }, }); } // JWT if (environment.security === 'jwt') { authReq = req.clone({ setHeaders: { Authorization: authHeader }, }); } return next.handle(authReq); } else { return next.handle(req); } } } As you may notice, this service is making use of an environment field environment.security to determine if we are using JWT or CSRF in order to inject the token accordingly. In your application you can combine both if necessary. Configure environment.ts file to use the CSRF/JWT. security: 'csrf' The authHeader used is obtained using the injected service AuthService already presented above. In order to activate the interceptor we need to provide it in our app.module.ts or core.module.ts depending on the application structure. Let’s assume that we are using the latter and the interceptor file is inside a security folder: ... import { HttpRequestInterceptorService } from './security/http-request-interceptor.service'; ... @NgModule({ imports: [...], exports: [...], declarations: [], providers: [ ... { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: HttpRequestInterceptorService, multi: true, }, ], }) export class CoreModule {} Angular automatically will now modify every request and include in the header the token if it is convenient.","title":"Consuming REST services","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guide-consuming-rest-services","url":"/typescript/current/angular/guide-consuming-rest-services.html","titles":[{"text":"Defining Adapters","hash":"_defining_adapters","id":1},{"text":"Token management","hash":"_token_management","id":2},{"text":"Store security token","hash":"_store_security_token","id":3},{"text":"Include token in every request","hash":"_include_token_in_every_request","id":4}]},"41":{"id":41,"text":"Please check before continuing this document Nx Workflow. To create an angular app with Nx, we simply create an Nx workspace with angular preset using the following command: npx create-nx-workspace --preset=angular The CLI will ask a series of questions and setup your workspace with an empty angular application. Figure 1. Creating a Nx workspace. Here we have given the workspace name as nx-guide and the app name as nx-ng-app. Let us have a look at the folder structure created by Nx CLI. Every Nx workspace has the following folder structure: myorg/ ├── apps/ ├── libs/ ├── tools/ ├── workspace.json ├── nx.json ├── package.json └── tsconfig.base.json Nx creates such a folder structure because it strongly supports the concept of monorepo, wherein all the inter-related applications and libraries are put together in the same repository for better maintenance, code-sharing and avoiding duplication of codes. As per the structure, all runnable applications should belong in the apps/ directory. Supporting applications and libraries can be put in the libs/ folder, with each library defining its own external API to differentiate between them. tools/ folder can contain scripts which act on your code like database scripts, for example. The JSON files contain various information and configuration settings about the workspace and the projects within them. You will find your angular app named nx-ng-app in the apps/ folder. The folder structure within your app is similar to any Angular app created with Angular CLI. Figure 2. Your Nx workspace in VSCode. You will also notice another app named nx-ng-app-e2e automatically generated in the apps folder. This for performing end-to-end testing with Cypress on your app. Now that we have created our angular app, let us serve it so we can view the application in our browser. You can still use the ng command to serve your application from your workspace root directory as such: ng serve nx-ng-app Using Nx, you can use either of the commands below for the same purpose: nx run my-app:serve nx serve my-app Once your code is compiled, you can view your application at http://localhost:4200 as usual.

Cypress is a framework “all in one” that provides the necessary libraries to write specific e2e tests, without the need of Selenium. Why Cypress? Uses JavaScript It works directly with the browser so the compatibility with the front-end framework the project uses (in this case Angular) is not a problem. Easy cross browser testing Install First of all we need to install it, we can use npm install: $ npm install -D cypress Or we can install it with yarn: $ yarn add -D cypress We need to run Cypress in order to get the folder tree downloaded, then create a tsconfig.json file inside cypress folder to add the typescript configuration. $ . /node_modules/.bin/cypress open tsconfig.json { \"compilerOptions\": { \"strict\": true, \"baseUrl\": \"../node_modules\", \"target\": \"es5\", \"lib\": [\"es5\", \"dom\"], \"types\": [\"cypress\"] }, \"include\": [ \"**/*.ts\" ] } BaseUrl Let’s setup the base URL so when we run the tests cypress will \"navigate\" to the right place, go to cypress.json on the root of the project. cypress.json { \"baseUrl\": \"http://localhost:4200\" } /cypress tsconfig.json /fixtures - example.json /integration - button.spec.ts - test.spec.ts /examples /plugins - index.js /support - commands.js - index.js tsconfig.json for typescript configuration. fixtures to store our mock data or files (images, mp3…​) to use on our tests. integration is where our tests go, by default it comes with an examples folder with tested samples. plugins is where the configuration files of the plugins go. support to add custom commands. If you are using Nx, it automatically generates a e2e cypress project for every project that you generate. So you already get the configuration files like tsconfig.json and cypress.json and also get the folder structure described above. This helps you focus more on writing your tests rather than setting up Cypress. The structure is the same than Mocha. First, we create a file, for example form.spec.ts, inside we define a context to group all our tests referred to the same subject. form.spec.ts context('Button page', () => { beforeEach(() => { cy.visit('/'); }); it('should have button',()=>{ cy.get('button').should('exist'); }); it('should contain PRESS',()=>{ cy.contains('button', 'PRESS'); }); }); beforeEach Visit '/' before every test. it Inside we write the test. The result: For more info check Cypress documentation On kitchensink you can find an official cypress demo with all the commands being used. We use fixtures to mock data, it can be a json, an image, video…​ { \"name\": \"Dummy name\", \"phone\": 999 99 99 99, \"body\": \"Mock data\" } You can store multiple mocks on the same fixture file. { \"create\":{\"name\": \"e2etestBox\"}, \"boxFruit\":{ \"uuid\":\"3376339576e33dfb9145362426a33333\", \"name\":\"e2etestBox\", \"visibility\":true, \"items\":[ {\"name\":\"apple\",\"units\":3}, {\"name\":\"kiwi\",\"units\":2}, ] }, } To access data we don’t need to import any file, we just call cy.fixture(filename) inside the **.spec.ts. We can name it as we want. cy.fixture('box.json').as('fruitBox') cy.fixture('box.json') we get access to box.json .as(fruitBox) is used to create an alias (fruitBox) to the fixture. For more info check Fixtures documentation With cypress you can test your application with real data or with mocks. Not using mocks guarantees that your tests are real e2e test but makes them vulnerable to external issues. When you mock data you don’t know exactly if the data and the structure received from the backend is correct because you are forcing a mock on the response, but you can avoid external issues, run test faster and have better control on the structure and status. To get more information go to Testing Strategies Cypress can intercept a XHR request and interact with it. cy.server(); cy.route( 'GET', '/apiUrl/list', [{\"name\":\"apple\", \"units\":3},{\"name\":\"kiwi\", \"units\":2}] ) cy.server(options) start a server to interact with the responses. cy.route(options) intercepts a XMLHttpRequests method GET URL /apiUrl/list' response [{\"name\":\"apple\", \"units\":3},{\"name\":\"kiwi\", \"units\":2}] Waits Every cypress action has a default await time to avoid asynchronous issues, but this time can be short for some particular actions like API calls, for those cases we can use cy.wait(). cy.server(); cy.route('/apiUrl/list').as('list'); cy.visit('/boxList'); cy.wait('@list'); You can find more information about cy.wait() here To mock data with fixtures: cy.fixture('box') .then(({boxFruit}) => { cy.route( 'GET', '/apiUrl/list', boxFruit ).as('boxFruit'); cy.get('#button').click(); cy.wait('@journalsList'); cy.get('#list').contains('apple'); }) We get boxFruit data from the box fixture and then we mock the API call with it so now the response of the call is boxFruit object. When the button is clicked, it waits to receive the response of the call and then checks if the list contains one of the elements of the fruitBox. Make a HTTP request. cy.server(); cy.request('http://localhost:4200/') .its('body') .should('include', 'Welcome to Devon4ngAngularElementsTest!'); If we have 'http://localhost:4200' as baseUrl on cypress.json cy.server(); cy.request('/') .its('body') .should('include', 'Welcome to Devon4ngAngularElementsTest!'); // Goes to http://localhost:4200/ We can add other options, like we can send the body of a form. cy.server(); cy.request({ method: 'POST', url: '/send', form: true, body: { name: 'name task', description: 'description of the task' } }); If you see yourself writing the same test more than once (login is a common one), you can create a custom command to make things faster. Cypress.Commands.add('name', ()⇒{}) to create the test. commands.ts Cypress.Commands.add('checkPlaceholder', (name) => { cy.get(`[name='${name}']`).click(); cy.get('mat-form-field.mat-focused').should('exist'); }); index.ts To use the commands we need to import the files on support/index.ts index.ts import './commands' import './file1' import './folder/file2' index.ts is where all our custom commands files unite so Cypress knows where to find them. And as we are using typescript we need to define a namespace, interface and define our function. index.d.ts declare namespace Cypress { interface Chainable { checkPlaceholder(name:string):Chainable } } Check typescript custom commands By default the browser used by Cypress is Chrome, it has compatibility with it’s family browsers (including Microsoft Edge) and has beta support for Mozilla Firefox. To change the browser on the panel we can do it by selecting the desired one on the browsers tab before running the spec file. Cypress will detect and display, except electron, only the browsers that you have already installed on your machine. Once the browser is selected, you can run your tests. To change the browser on the automatic test run, you can add a flag on the node command cypress run --browser edge Only if we use the cypress run command. Or we can change the script file. cypress/script.js const runTests= async ()=>{ ... const {totalFailed} = await cypress.run({browser:'edge'}); ... }; Cypress documentation Cypress allow us to create tests depending on the Viewport, so we can test responsiveness. There are different ways to use it: Inside a test case it('should change title when viewport is less than 320px', ()=>{ cy.get('.title-l').should('be.visible'); cy.get('.title-s').should('not.be.visible'); cy.viewport(320, 480); cy.get('.title-l').should('not.be.visible'); cy.get('.title-s').should('be.visible'); }) Passing the configuration as an option describe('page display on medium size screen', { viewportHeight: 1000, viewportWidth: 400 }, () => { ... }) Or we can set a default cypress.json ... { \"viewportHeight\": 1000 \"viewportWidth\": 400, } ... Viewport documentation We can get false negatives intermittently due external issues that can affect our tests, because of that we can add, in the configuration, a retries entry so Cypress can run again a certain failed test the selected number of times to verify that the error is real. We can set retries for run or open mode. cypress.json ... \"retries\": { \"runMode\": 3, \"openMode\": 3 } ... The retries can be configured on the cypress.json or directly on a specific test. it('should get button', { retries: { runMode: 2, openMode: 2 } }, () => { ... }) This retries those not shown on the test log. Check more on retries documentation The tests results appear on the terminal, but to have a more friendly view we can add a reporter. In this case we are going to use Mochawesome, initially its a Mocha reporter but as Cypress uses Mocha it works the same. Install npm npm install --save-dev mochawesome yarn yarn add -D mochawesome To run the reporter: cypress run --reporter mochawesome Mochawesome saves by default the generated files on `./mochawesome-report/` but we can add options to change this behavior. Options can be passed to the reporter in two ways Using a flag cypress run --reporter mochawesome --reporter-options reportDir=report Or on cypress.json { \"baseUrl\": \"http://localhost:4200\", \"reporter\": \"mochawesome\", \"reporterOptions\": { \"overwrite\": false, \"html\": false, \"json\": true, \"reportDir\": \"cypress/report\" } } Overwrite:false to not overwrite every **:spec.ts test report, we want them to create a merged version later. reportDir to set a custom directory. html:false because we don’t need it. json:true to save them on json. Mochawesome only creates the html file of the last .spec.ts file that the tests run, that’s why we don’t generate html reports directly, in order to stack them all on the same final html we need to merge the reports. Check the mochawesome documentation mochawesome-merge Mochawesome-merge is a library that helps us to merge the different json. npm npm install --save-dev mochawesome-merge npm install --save-dev mochawesome-report-generator yarn yarn add -D mochawesome-merge yarn add -D mochawesome-report-generator To merge the files we execute this command: mochawesome-merge cypress/report/*.json > cypress/reportFinal.json reportFinal.json is the result of this merge, whit that we have the data of all the spec files in one json. We can also automate the test, merge and conversion to html using a script. const cypress = require('cypress'); const fse = require('fs-extra'); const { merge } = require('mochawesome-merge'); const generator = require('mochawesome-report-generator'); const runTests= async ()=>{ await fse.remove('mochawesome-report'); await fse.remove('cypress/report'); const {totalFailed} = await cypress.run(); const reporterOptions = { files: [\"cypress/report/*.json\"] }; await generateReport(reporterOptions); if(totalFailed !== 0){ process.exit(2); }; }; const generateReport = (options)=> { return merge(options).then((jsonReport)=>{ generator.create(jsonReport).then(()=>{ process.exit(); }); }); }; runTests(); fse.remove() to remove older reports data. cypress.run() to run the tests. merge(options) we merge the json output from running the tests. generator.create(jsonReport) then we generate the html view of the report.

Using a global error handler will avoid mistakes and provide a use friendly interface allowing us to indicate the user what problem is happening. ErrorHandler is the class that Angular uses by default to control the errors. This means that, even if the application doesn’t have a ErrorHandler it is going to use the one setup by default in Angular. This can be tested by trying to find a page not existing in any app, instantly Angular will print the error in the console. In order to create a custom ErrorHandler three steps are going to be needed: In this first step the custom ErrorHandler class is going to be created inside the folder /app/core/errors/errors-handler.ts: import { ErrorHandler, Injectable, Injector } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpErrorResponse } from '@angular/common/http'; @Injectable() export class ErrorsHandler implements ErrorHandler { constructor(private injector: Injector) {} handleError(error: Error | HttpErrorResponse) { // To do: Use injector to get the necessary services to redirect or // show a message to the user const classname = error.constructor.name; switch ( classname ) { case 'HttpErrorResponse': console.error('HttpError:' + error.message); if (!navigator.onLine) { console.error('There's no internet connection'); // To do: control here in internet what you wanna do if user has no internet } else { console.error('Server Error:' + error.message); // To do: control here if the server gave an error } break; default: console.error('Error:' + error.message); // To do: control here if the client/other things gave an error } } } This class can be used to control the different type of errors. If wanted, the classname variable could be used to add more switch cases. This would allow control of more specific situations. Inside the same folder created in the last step we are going to create the ErrorInterceptor(errors-handler-interceptor.ts). This ErrorInterceptor is going to retry any failed calls to the server to make sure it is not being found before showing the error: import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler, HttpEvent } from '@angular/common/http'; import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { Observable } from 'rxjs'; import { retry } from 'rxjs/operators'; @Injectable() export class ErrorsHandlerInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor { constructor() {} intercept(req: HttpRequest, next: HttpHandler): Observable> { return next.handle(req).pipe( retryWhen((errors: Observable) => errors.pipe( delay(500), take(5), concatMap((error: any, retryIndex: number) => { if (++retryIndex === 5) { throw error; } return of(error); }) )) ); } } This custom made interceptor is implementing the HttpInterceptor and inside the method intercept using the method pipe,retryWhen,delay,take and concatMap from RxJs it is going to do the next things if there is errors: With delay(500) do a delay to allow some time in between requests With take(5) retry five times. With concatMap if the index that take() gives is not 5 it returns the error, else, it throws the error. Finally, creating a module(errors-handler.module.ts) is necessary to include the interceptor and the custom error handler. In this case, the module is going to be created in the same folder as the last two: import { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core'; import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common'; import { ErrorsHandler } from './errors-handler'; import { HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@angular/common/http'; import { ErrorsHandlerInterceptor } from './errors-handler-interceptor'; @NgModule({ declarations: [], // Declare here component if you want to use routing to error component imports: [ CommonModule ], providers: [ { provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: ErrorsHandler, }, { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: ErrorsHandlerInterceptor, multi: true, } ] }) export class ErrorsHandlerModule { } This module simply is providing the services that are implemented by our custom classes and then telling angular to use our custom made classes instead of the default ones. After doing this, the module has to be included in the app module app.module.ts in order to be used. .... imports: [ ErrorsHandlerModule, .... As a final step, handling these errors is necessary. There are different ways that can be used to control the errors, here are a few: Creating a custom page and using with Router to redirect to a page showing an error. Creating a service in the server side or Backend to create a log with the error and calling it with HttpClient. Showing a custom made SnackBar with the error message. If the SnackBar is used directly, some errors can occur, this is due to SnackBar being out of the Angular zone. In order to use this service properly, NgZone is necessary. The method run() from NgZone will allow the service to be inside the Angular Zone. An example on how to use it: import { ErrorHandler, Injectable, Injector, NgZone } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpErrorResponse } from '@angular/common/http'; import { MatSnackBar } from '@angular/material'; @Injectable() export class ErrorsHandler implements ErrorHandler { constructor(private injector: Injector, private zone: NgZone) {} handleError(error: Error | HttpErrorResponse) { // Use injector to get the necessary services to redirect or const snackBar: MatSnackBar = this.injector.get(MatSnackBar); const classname = error.constructor.name; let message: string; switch ( classname ) { case 'HttpErrorResponse': message = !(navigator.onLine) ? 'There is no internet connection' : error.message; break; default: message = error.message; } this.zone.run( () => snackBar.open(message, 'danger', { duration : 4000}) ); } } Using Injector the MatSnackBar is obtained, then the correct message is obtained inside the switch. Finally, using NgZone and run(), we open the SnackBar passing the message, and the parameters wanted.

TSLint is a fantastic tool. It is a linter that was written specifically to work based on the TypeScript AST format. This has advantages and disadvantages, as with most decisions we are faced with in software engineering! One advantage is there is no tooling required to reconcile differences between ESLint and TypeScript AST formats, but the major disadvantage is that the tool is therefore unable to reuse any of the previous work which has been done in the JavaScript ecosystem around linting, and it has to re-implement everything from scratch. Everything from rules to auto-fixing capabilities and more. However, the backers behind TSLint announced in 2019 that they would be deprecating TSLint in favor of supporting typescript-eslint in order to benefit the community. You can read more about that here The TypeScript Team themselves also announced their plans to move the TypeScript codebase from TSLint to typescript-eslint, and they have been big supporters of this project. More details at https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30553 Angular ESLint support comes from the angular-eslint tooling package. Angular documentation also links to this repository as you can check in the ng lint section of the Angular CLI documentation. In order to create a brand new Angular CLI workspace which uses ESLint instead of TSLint and Codelyzer, simply run the following commands: # Install the Angular CLI and @angular-eslint/schematics globally however you want (e.g. npm, yarn, volta etc) $ npm i -g @angular/cli @angular-devkit/core @angular-devkit/schematics @angular-eslint/schematics # Create a new Angular CLI workspace using the @angular-eslint/schematics collection (instead of the default) $ ng new --collection=@angular-eslint/schematics The first step is to run the schematic to add @angular-eslint to your project: $ ng add @angular-eslint/schematics This will handle installing the latest version of all the relevant packages for you and adding them to the devDependencies of your package.json. The next thing to do is consider which \"project\" you want to migrate to use ESLint. If you have a single application in your workspace you will likely have just a single entry in the projects configuration object within your angular.json file. If you have a projects/` directory in your workspace, you will have multiple entries in your projects configuration and you will need to chose which one you want to migrate using the convert-tslint-to-eslint schematic. You can run it like so: $ ng g @angular-eslint/schematics:convert-tslint-to-eslint {{YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_GOES_HERE}} From now on, ng lint will use ESLint! Once you are happy with your ESLint setup, you simply need to remove the root-level tslint.json and potentially uninstall TSLint and any TSLint-related plugins/dependencies if your Angular CLI workspace is now no longer using TSLint at all.

You might put this \"top-level file structure\" into a sub-directory to facilitate your build, but this is not relevant for this guide. So the applications file structure relevant to this guide is the folder /src/app inside the part managed by Angular CLI. Top-level file structure shows feature modules /src └── /app ├── /account-management ├── /billing ├── /booking ├── /core ├── /shared ├── /status | ├── app.module.ts ├── app.component.spec.ts ├── app.component.ts └── app.routing-module.ts Besides the definition of app module the app folder has feature modules on top-level. The special modules shared and core are present as well. A feature module contains the modules definition and two folders representing both layers. Feature module file structure has both layers /src └── /app └── /account-management ├── /components ├── /services | ├── account-management.module.ts ├── account-management.component.spec.ts ├── account-management.component.ts └── account-management.routing-module.ts Additionally an entry component is possible. This would be the case in lazy loading scenarios. So account-management.component.ts would be only present if account-management is lazy loaded. Otherwise, the module’s routes would be defined Component-less (see vsavkin blog post). The component layer reflects the distinction between Smart Components and Dumb Components. Components layer file structure shows Smart Components on top-level /src └── /app └── /account-management └── /components ├── /account-overview ├── /confirm-modal ├── /create-account ├── /forgot-password └── /shared Every folder inside the /components folder represents a smart component. The only exception is /shared. /shared contains Dumb Components shared across Smart Components inside the components layer.

Besides that are folders containing the Dumb Components the Smart Component consists of. This can be recursive - a Dumb Component can consist of other Dumb Components. This is reflected by the file structure as well. This way the structure of a view becomes very readable. As mentioned before, if a Dumb Component is used by multiple Smart Components inside the components layer it is put inside the /shared folder inside the components layer. With this way of thinking the shared module makes a lot of sense. If a Dumb Component is used by multiple Smart Components from different feature modules, the Dumb Component is placed into the shared module. The shared module contains Dumb Components shared across Smart Components from different feature modules /src └── /app └── /shared └── /user-panel | ├── user-panel.component.html ├── user-panel.component.scss ├── user-panel.component.spec.ts └── user-panel.component.ts The layer folder /components is not necessary inside the shared module.

More info at Angular i18n official documentation The official approach could be a bit complicated, therefore the recommended one is to use the recommended library Transloco from https://github.com/ngneat/transloco/. In order to include this library in your devon4ng Angular >= 7.2 project you will need to execute in a terminal: $ ng add @ngneat/transloco As part of the installation process you’ll be presented with questions; Once you answer them, everything you need will automatically be created for you. First, Transloco creates boilerplate files for the requested translations. Next, it will create a new file, transloco-root.module.ts which exposes an Angular’s module with a default configuration, and inject it into the AppModule. import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; import { TRANSLOCO_LOADER, Translation, TranslocoLoader, TRANSLOCO_CONFIG, translocoConfig, TranslocoModule } from '@ngneat/transloco'; import { Injectable, NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { environment } from '../environments/environment'; @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) export class TranslocoHttpLoader implements TranslocoLoader { constructor(private http: HttpClient) {} getTranslation(lang: string) { return this.http.get(`/assets/i18n/${lang}.json`); } } @NgModule({ exports: [ TranslocoModule ], providers: [ { provide: TRANSLOCO_CONFIG, useValue: translocoConfig({ availableLangs: ['en', 'es'], defaultLang: 'en', // Remove this option if your application doesn't support changing language in runtime. reRenderOnLangChange: true, prodMode: environment.production, }) }, { provide: TRANSLOCO_LOADER, useClass: TranslocoHttpLoader } ] }) export class TranslocoRootModule {} As you might have noticed it also set an HttpLoader into the module’s providers. The HttpLoader is a class that implements the TranslocoLoader interface. It’s responsible for instructing Transloco how to load the translation files. It uses Angular HTTP client to fetch the files, based on the given path. In order to translate any label in any HTML template you will need to use the transloco pipe available: {{ 'HELLO' | transloco }} An optional parameter from the component TypeScript class could be included as follows: {{ 'HELLO' | transloco: { value: dynamic } }} It is possible to use with inputs: Attribute Property In order to change the language used you will need to create a button or selector that calls the this.translocoService.use(language: string) method from TranslocoService. For example: export class AppComponent { constructor(private translocoService: TranslocoService) {} changeLanguage(lang) { this.translocoService.setActiveLang(lang); } } The translations will be included in the en.json, es.json, de.json, etc. files inside the /assets/i18n folder. For example en.json would be (using the previous parameter): { \"HELLO\": \"hello\" } Or with an optional parameter: { \"HELLO\": \"hello {{value}}\" } Transloco understands nested JSON objects. This means that you can have a translation that looks like this: { \"HOME\": { \"HELLO\": \"hello {{value}}\" } } In order to access access the value, use the dot notation, in this case HOME.HELLO. Using a structural directive is the recommended approach. It’s DRY and efficient, as it creates one subscription per template: {{ t('title') }} Note that the t function is memoized. It means that given the same key it will return the result directly from the cache. We can pass a params object as the second parameter: {{ t('name', { name: 'Transloco' }) }} We can instruct the directive to use a different language in our template: {{ t('title') }} The use of pipes can be possible too: template: {{ 'HELLO' | transloco:param }} component: param = {value: 'world'}; The last option available with transloco is the attribute directive: If you need to access translations in any component or service you can do it injecting the TranslocoService into them: // Sync translation translocoService.translate('HELLO', {value: 'world'}); // Async translation translocoService.selectTranslate('HELLO', { value: 'world' }).subscribe(res => { console.log(res); //=> 'hello world' }); You can find a complete example at https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template.

We will create an application with a header containing some menu links and a sidenav with some navigation links. Figure 1. This is what the finished application will look like We start with opening the devonfw IDE(right-click anywhere in your workspace and click \"Open devonfw CMD shell here\") and running the following command to start a project named devon4ng-mat-layout ng new devon4ng-mat-layout --routing --style=scss. If you are using Nx, the command would be nx generate @nrwl/angular:app devon4ng-mat-layout --routing --style=scss in your Nx workspace. Click here to get started with using Nx. We are providing the routing flag so that a routing module is generated, and we are also setting the style sheet format to SCSS with --style=scss. Once the creation process is complete, open your newly created application in Visual Studio Code. Try running the empty application by running the following command in the integrated terminal: ng serve. (If you are using Nx, you have to specify the project name along with the --project flag, so the command becomes ng serve --project=devon4ng-mat-layout) Angular will spin up a server and you can check your application by visiting http://localhost:4200/ in your browser. Figure 2. Blank application Next we will add Angular Material to our application. In the integrated terminal, press Ctrl + C to terminate the running application and run the following command: npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations You can also use Yarn to install the dependencies if you prefer that: yarn add @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations Once the dependencies are installed, we need to import the BrowserAnimationsModule in our AppModule for animations support. Importing BrowserAnimationsModule in AppModule import {BrowserAnimationsModule} from '@angular/platform-browser/animations'; @NgModule({ ... imports: [BrowserAnimationsModule], ... }) export class AppModule { } Angular Material provides a host of components for designing our application. All the components are well structured into individual NgModules. For each component from the Angular Material library that we want to use, we have to import the respective NgModule. We will be using the following components in our application: import { MatIconModule, MatButtonModule, MatMenuModule, MatListModule, MatToolbarModule, MatSidenavModule } from '@angular/material'; @NgModule({ ... imports: [ ... MatIconModule, MatButtonModule, MatMenuModule, MatListModule, MatToolbarModule, MatSidenavModule, ... ], ... }) export class AppModule { } A better approach is to import and then export all the required components in a shared module. But for the sake of simplicity, we are importing all the required components in the AppModule itself. You can find a working copy of this application https://github.com/devonfw-sample/devon4ts-samples/tree/master/apps/angular-material-basic-layout[here]. The sample application is part of a Nx workspace, which means it is one of the many apps in a monorepo and capable of importing reusable code from a shared library. This guide describes the implementaion by assuming a stand-alone single-repo application, but the pages and layout described in this sample app are similar to the ones used in another sample app in the monorepo (https://github.com/devonfw-sample/devon4ts-samples/tree/master/apps/angular-material-theming[angular-material-theming]), which is why we have exported the required components from a shared library and reused them in both the apps. As a result, the code in our monorepo will be slightly different. It would still help you in following this guide. Next, we include a theme in our application. Angular Material comes with four pre-defined themes: indigo-pink, deeppurple-amber, pink-bluegrey and purple-green. It is also possible to create our own custom theme, but that is beyond the scope of this guide. Including a theme is required to apply all of the core and theme styles to your application. We will include the indigo-pink theme in our application by importing the indigo-pink.css file in our src/styles.scss: In src/styles.scss: @import \"~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\"; To use Material Design Icons along with the mat-icon component, we will load the Material Icons library in our src/index.html file In src/index.html: Now that we have all the Angular Material related dependencies set up in our project, we can start coding. Let’s begin by adding a suitable margin and font to the body element of our single page application. We will add it in the src/styles.scss file to apply it globally: In src/styles.scss: body { margin: 0; font-family: \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, sans-serif; } At this point, if we run our application, this is how it will look like: Figure 3. Application with Angular Material set up We will clear the app.component.html file and setup a header with a menu button and some navigational links. We will use mat-toolbar, mat-button, mat-menu, mat-icon and mat-icon-button for this: app.component.html: menu Menu 1 Menu 2 Menu 3 Sub-menu 1 Sub-menu 2 Menu Item 1 Menu Item 2 Menu Item 3 The color attribute on the mat-toolbar element will give it the primary (indigo) color as defined by our theme. The color attribute works with most Angular Material components; the possible values are 'primary', 'accent' and 'warn'. The mat-toolbar is a suitable component to represent a header. It serves as a placeholder for elements we want in our header. Inside the mat-toolbar, we start with a button having mat-icon-button attribute, which itself contains a mat-icon element having the value menu. This will serve as a menu button which we can use to toggle the sidenav. We follow it with some sample buttons having the mat-button attribute. Notice the first button has a property matMenuTriggerFor bound to a local reference submenu. As the property name suggests, the click of this button will display the mat-menu element with the specified local reference as a drop-down menu. The rest of the code is self explanatory. Figure 4. This is how our application looks with the first menu button (Menu 1) clicked. We want to keep the sidenav toggling menu button on the left and move the rest to the right to make it look better. To do this we add a class to the menu icon button: app.component.html: ... menu ... And in the app.component.scss file, we add the following style: app.component.scss: .menu { margin-right: auto; } The mat-toolbar element already has it’s display property set to flex. Setting the menu icon button’s margin-right property to auto keeps itself on the left and pushes the other elements to the right. Figure 5. Final look of the header. Next, we will create a sidenav. But before that lets create a couple of components to navigate between, the links of which we will add to the sidenav. We will use the ng generate component (or ng g c command for short) to create Home and Data components. (Append --project=devon4ng-mat-layout to the command in a Nx workspace). We nest them in the pages sub-directory since they represent our pages. ng g c pages/home ng g c pages/data; Let us set up the routing such that when we visit http://localhost:4200/ root url we see the HomeComponent and when we visit http://localhost:4200/data url we see the DataComponent. We had opted for routing while creating the application, so we have the routing module app-routing.module.ts setup for us. In this file, we have the empty routes array where we set up our routes. app-routing.module.ts: import { HomeComponent } from './pages/home/home.component'; import { DataComponent } from './pages/data/data.component'; const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', component: HomeComponent }, { path: 'data', component: DataComponent } ]; We need to provide a hook where the components will be loaded when their respective URLs are loaded. We do that by using the router-outlet directive in the app.component.html. app.component.html: ... Now when we visit the defined URLs we see the appropriate components rendered on screen. Lets change the contents of the components to have something better. home.component.html: Home Page home.component.scss: h2 { text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; } data.component.html: Data Page data.component.scss: h2 { text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; } The pages look somewhat better now: Figure 6. Home page Figure 7. Data page Let us finally create the sidenav. To implement the sidenav we need to use 3 Angular Material components: mat-sidenav-container, mat-sidenav and mat-sidenav-content. The mat-sidenav-container, as the name suggests, acts as a container for the sidenav and the associated content. So it is the parent element, and mat-sidenav and mat-sidenav-content are the children sibling elements. mat-sidenav represents the sidenav. We can put any content we want, though it is usually used to contain a list of navigational links. The mat-sidenav-content element is for containing the contents of our current page. Since we need the sidenav application-wide, we will put it in the app.component.html. app.component.html: ... Sidenav The mat-sidenav has a mode property, which accepts one of the 3 values: over, push and side. It decides the behavior of the sidenav. mat-sidenav also has a disableClose property which accents a boolean value. It toggles the behavior where we click on the backdrop or press the Esc key to close the sidenav. There are other properties which we can use to customize the appearance, behavior and position of the sidenav. You can find the properties documented online at https://material.angular.io/components/sidenav/api We moved the router-outlet directive inside the mat-sidenav-content where it will render the routed component. But if you check the running application in the browser, we don’t see the sidenav yet. That is because it is closed. We want to have the sidenav opened/closed at the click of the menu icon button on the left side of the header we implemented earlier. Notice we have set a local reference #sidenav on the mat-sidenav element. We can access this element and call its toggle() function to toggle open or close the sidenav. app.component.html: ... menu ... Figure 8. Sidenav is implemented We can now open the sidenav by clicking the menu icon button. But it does not look right. The sidenav is only as wide as its content. Also the page does not stretch the entire viewport due to lack of content. Let’s add the following styles to make the page fill the viewport: app.component.scss: ... mat-sidenav-container { position: absolute; top: 64px; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; } The sidenav width will be corrected when we add the navigational links to it. That is the only thing remaining to be done. Lets implement it now: app.component.html: ... home Home sample home page grid_on Data sample data page ... We use the mat-nav-list element to set a list of navigational links. We use the a tags with mat-list-item directive. We implement a click listener on each link to close the sidenav when it is clicked. The routerLink directive is used to provide the URLs to navigate to. The routerLinkActive directive is used to provide the class name which will be added to the link when it’s URL is visited. Here we name the class`active`. To style it, let' modify the app.component.scss file: app.component.scss: ... mat-sidenav-container { ... a.active { background: #8e8d8d; color: #fff; p { color: #4a4a4a; } } } Now we have a working application with a basic layout: a header with some menu and a sidenav with some navigational links. Figure 9. Finished application The purpose of this guide was to provide a basic understanding of creating layouts with Angular Material. The Angular Material library has a huge collection of ready to use components which can be found at https://material.angular.io/components/categories It has provided documentation and example usage for each of its components. Going through the documentation will give a better understanding of using Angular Material components in our devon4ng applications.","title":"Angular Material Layout","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guide-layout-with-angular-material","url":"/typescript/current/angular/guide-layout-with-angular-material.html","titles":[{"text":"Create a new angular application","hash":"_create_a_new_angular_application","id":1},{"text":"Adding Angular Material library to the project","hash":"_adding_angular_material_library_to_the_project","id":2},{"text":"Development","hash":"_development","id":3},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"_conclusion","id":4}]},"49":{"id":49,"text":"Reducers are pure functions, meaning they are side-effect free and deterministic. Many actions however have side effects like sending messages or displaying a toast notification. NgRx encapsulates these actions in effects. Let’s build a recommended movies list so the user can add movies to their watchlist. Create a module for recommendations and add stores and states as in the previous chapter. Add EffectsModule.forRoot([]) to the imports in AppModule below StoreModule.forRoot(). Add effects to the feature module: ng generate effect recommendation/Recommendation -m recommendation/recommendation.module.ts We need actions for loading the movie list, success and failure cases: recommendation/actions/index.ts import { createAction, props, union } from '@ngrx/store'; import { Movie } from 'src/app/watchlist/models/movies'; export const loadRecommendedMovies = createAction('[Recommendation List] Load movies'); export const loadRecommendedMoviesSuccess = createAction('[Recommendation API] Load movies success', props()); export const loadRecommendedMoviesFailure = createAction('[Recommendation API] Load movies failure', props()); const actions = union({ loadRecommendedMovies, loadRecommendedMoviesSuccess, loadRecommendedMoviesFailure }); export type ActionsUnion = typeof actions; In the reducer, we use a loading flag so the UI can show a loading spinner. The store is updated with arriving data. recommendation/actions/index.ts export interface State { items: Movie[]; loading: boolean; } export const initialState: State = { items: [], loading: false }; export function reducer(state = initialState, action: recommendationActions.ActionsUnion): State { switch (action.type) { case '[Recommendation List] Load movies': return { ...state, items: [], loading: true }; case '[Recommendation API] Load movies failure': return { ...state, loading: false }; case '[Recommendation API] Load movies success': return { ...state, items: action.movies, loading: false }; default: return state; } } export const getAll = (state: State) => state.items; export const isLoading = (state: State) => state.loading; We need an API service to talk to the server. For demonstration purposes, we simulate an answer delayed by one second: recommendation/services/recommendation-api.service.ts @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) export class RecommendationApiService { private readonly recommendedMovies: Movie[] = [ { id: 2, title: 'The Hunger Games', genre: 'sci-fi', releaseYear: 2012, runtimeMinutes: 144 }, { id: 4, title: 'Avengers: Endgame', genre: 'fantasy', releaseYear: 2019, runtimeMinutes: 181 } ]; loadRecommendedMovies(): Observable { return of(this.recommendedMovies).pipe(delay(1000)); } } Here are the effects: recommendation/services/recommendation-api.service.ts @Injectable() export class RecommendationEffects { constructor( private actions$: Actions, private recommendationApi: RecommendationApiService, ) { } @Effect() loadBooks$ = this.actions$.pipe( ofType(recommendationActions.loadRecommendedMovies.type), switchMap(() => this.recommendationApi.loadRecommendedMovies().pipe( map(movies => recommendationActions.loadRecommendedMoviesSuccess({ movies })), catchError(error => of(recommendationActions.loadRecommendedMoviesFailure({ error }))) )) ); } Effects are always observables and return actions. In this example, we consume the actions observable provided by NgRx and listen only for the loadRecommendedMovies actions by using the ofType operator. Using switchMap, we map to a new observable, one that loads movies and maps the successful result to a new loadRecommendedMoviesSuccess action or a failure to loadRecommendedMoviesFailure. In a real application we would show a notification in the error case. If an effect should not dispatch another action, return an empty observable.

NgRx/Entity provides convenience functions if each item of a collection has an id property. Luckily all our entities already have this property. Let’s add functionality to add a movie to the watchlist. First, create the required action: recommendation/actions/index.ts export const addToWatchlist = createAction('[Recommendation List] Add to watchlist', props()); You may wonder why the Date object is not created inside the reducer instead, since it should always be the current time. However, remember that reducers should be deterministic state machines — State A + Action B should always result in the same State C. This makes reducers easily testable. Then, rewrite the watchlistData reducer to make use of NgRx/Entity: recommendation/actions/index.ts export interface State extends EntityState { (1) } export const entityAdapter = createEntityAdapter(); (2) export const initialState: State = entityAdapter.getInitialState(); (3) const entitySelectors = entityAdapter.getSelectors(); export function reducer(state = initialState, action: playbackActions.ActionsUnion | recommendationActions.ActionsUnion): State { switch (action.type) { case playbackActions.playbackFinished.type: const itemToUpdate = entitySelectors .selectAll(state) (4) .find(item => item.movie.id === action.movieId); if (itemToUpdate) { return entityAdapter.updateOne({ (5) id: itemToUpdate.id, changes: { playbackMinutes: action.stoppedAtMinute } (6) }, state); } else { return state; } case recommendationActions.addToWatchlist.type: return entityAdapter.addOne({id: action.watchlistItemId, movie: action.movie, added: action.addedAt, playbackMinutes: 0}, state); default: return state; } } export const getAllItems = entitySelectors.selectAll; 1 NgRx/Entity requires state to extend EntityState. It provides a list of ids and a dictionary of id ⇒ entity entries 2 The entity adapter provides data manipulation operations and selectors 3 The state can be initialized with getInitialState(), which accepts an optional object to define any additional state beyond EntityState 4 selectAll returns an array of all entities 5 All adapter operations consume the state object as the last argument and produce a new state 6 Update methods accept a partial change definition; you don’t have to clone the object This concludes the tutorial on NgRx.

You may wonder why you should bother with state management. Usually data resides in a back-end storage system, e.g. a database, and is retrieved by the client on a per-need basis. To add, update, or delete entities from this store, clients have to invoke API endpoints at the back-end. Mimicking database-like transactions on the client side may seem redundant. However, there are many use cases for which a global client-side state is appropriate: the client has some kind of global state which should survive the destruction of a component, but does not warrant server side persistence, for example: volume level of media, expansion status of menus sever side data should not be retrieved every time it is needed, either because multiple components consume it, or because it should be cached, e.g. the personal watchlist in an online streaming app the app provides a rich experience with offline functionality, e.g. a native app built with Ionic Saving global states inside the services they originates from results in a data flow that is hard to follow and state becoming inconsistent due to unordered state mutations. Following the single source of truth principle, there should be a central location holding all your application’s state, just like a server side database does. State management libraries for Angular provide tools for storing, retrieving, and updating client-side state. As stated in the introduction, devon4ng does not stipulate a particular state library, or require using one at all. However, NgRx has proven to be a robust, mature solution for this task, with good tooling and 3rd-party library support. Albeit introducing a level of indirection that requires additional effort even for simple features, the Redux concept enforces a clear separation of concerns leading to a cleaner architecture. Nonetheless, you should always compare different approaches to state management and pick the best one suiting your use case. Here’s a (non-exhaustive) list of competing state management libraries: Plain RxJS using the simple store described in Abstract Class Store NgXS reduces some boilerplate of NgRx by leveraging the power of decorators and moving side effects to the store MobX follows a more imperative approach in contrast to the functional Redux pattern Akita also uses an imperative approach with direct setters in the store, but keeps the concept of immutable state transitions To get a quick start, use the provided template for devon4ng + NgRx. To manually install the core store package together with a set of useful extensions: NPM: `npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/entity @ngrx/store-devtools --save` Yarn: `yarn add @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/entity @ngrx/store-devtools` We recommend to add the NgRx schematics to your project so you can create code artifacts from the command line: NPM: `npm install @ngrx/schematics --save-dev` Yarn: `yarn add @ngrx/schematics --dev` Afterwards, make NgRx your default schematics provider, so you don’t have to type the qualified package name every time: `ng config cli.defaultCollection @ngrx/schematics` If you have custom settings for Angular schematics, you have to configure them as described here. Figure 1. NgRx architecture overview Figure 1 gives an overview of the NgRx data flow. The single source of truth is managed as an immutable state object by the store. Components dispatch actions to trigger state changes. Actions are handed over to reducers, which take the current state and action data to compute the next state. Actions are also consumed by-effects, which perform side-effects such as retrieving data from the back-end, and may dispatch new actions as a result. Components subscribe to state changes using selectors.

We will model a particular feature, a watchlist that can be populated by the user with movies she or he wants to see in the future. If you’re starting fresh, you first have to initialize NgRx and create a root state. The fastest way to do this is using the schematic: `ng generate @ngrx/schematics:store State --root --module app.module.ts` This will automatically generate a root store and register it in the app module. Next we generate a feature module for the watchlist: ` ng generate module watchlist` and create a corresponding feature store: ` ng generate store watchlist/Watchlist -m watchlist.module.ts` This generates a file watchlist/reducers/index.ts with the reducer function, and registers the store in the watchlist module declaration. If you’re getting an error Schematic \"store\" not found in collection \"@schematics/angular\", this means you forgot to register the NgRx schematics as default. Next, add the WatchlistModule to the AppModule imports so the feature store is registered when the application starts. We also added the store devtools which we will use later, resulting in the following file: app.module.ts import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; import { EffectsModule } from '@ngrx/effects'; import { AppEffects } from './app.effects'; import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store'; import { reducers, metaReducers } from './reducers'; import { StoreDevtoolsModule } from '@ngrx/store-devtools'; import { environment } from '../environments/environment'; import { WatchlistModule } from './watchlist/watchlist.module'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent ], imports: [ BrowserModule, WatchlistModule, StoreModule.forRoot(reducers, { metaReducers }), // Instrumentation must be imported after importing StoreModule (config is optional) StoreDevtoolsModule.instrument({ maxAge: 25, // Retains last 25 states logOnly: environment.production, // Restrict extension to log-only mode }), !environment.production ? StoreDevtoolsModule.instrument() : [] ], providers: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { } We need a simple model for our list of movies. Create a file watchlist/models/movies.ts and insert the following code: export interface Movie { id: number; title: string; releaseYear: number; runtimeMinutes: number; genre: Genre; } export type Genre = 'action' | 'fantasy' | 'sci-fi' | 'romantic' | 'comedy' | 'mystery'; export interface WatchlistItem { id: number; movie: Movie; added: Date; playbackMinutes: number; } We discourage putting several types into the same file and do this only for the sake of keeping this tutorial brief. Later we will learn how to retrieve data from the back-end using effects. For now we will create an initial state for the user with a default movie. State is defined and transforms by a reducer function. Let’s create a watchlist reducer: ``` cd watchlist/reducers ng g reducer WatchlistData --reducers index.ts ``` Open the generated file watchlist-data.reducer.ts. You see three exports: The State interface defines the shape of the state. There is only one instance of a feature state in the store at all times. The initialState constant is the state at application creation time. The reducer function will later be called by the store to produce the next state instance based on the current state and an action object. Let’s put a movie into the user’s watchlist: watchlist-data.reducer.ts export interface State { items: WatchlistItem[]; } export const initialState: State = { items: [ { id: 42, movie: { id: 1, title: 'Die Hard', genre: 'action', releaseYear: 1988, runtimeMinutes: 132 }, playbackMinutes: 0, added: new Date(), } ] }; State slices can be retrieved from the store using selectors. Create a watchlist component: `ng g c watchlist/Watchlist` and add it to the exports of WatchlistModule. Also, replace app.component.html with State observables are obtained using selectors. They are memoized by default, meaning that you don’t have to worry about performance if you use complicated calculations when deriving state — these are only performed once per state emission. Add a selector to watchlist-data.reducer.ts: `export const getAllItems = (state: State) => state.items;` Next, we have to re-export the selector for this sub-state in the feature reducer. Modify the watchlist/reducers/index.ts like this: watchlist/reducers/index.ts import { ActionReducer, ActionReducerMap, createFeatureSelector, createSelector, MetaReducer } from '@ngrx/store'; import { environment } from 'src/environments/environment'; import * as fromWatchlistData from './watchlist-data.reducer'; import * as fromRoot from 'src/app/reducers/index'; export interface WatchlistState { (1) watchlistData: fromWatchlistData.State; } export interface State extends fromRoot.State { (2) watchlist: WatchlistState; } export const reducers: ActionReducerMap = { (3) watchlistData: fromWatchlistData.reducer, }; export const metaReducers: MetaReducer[] = !environment.production ? [] : []; export const getFeature = createFeatureSelector('watchlist'); (4) export const getWatchlistData = createSelector( (5) getFeature, state => state.watchlistData ); export const getAllItems = createSelector( (6) getWatchlistData, fromWatchlistData.getAllItems ); 1 The feature state, each member is managed by a different reducer 2 Feature states are registered by the forFeature method. This interface provides a typesafe path from root to feature state. 3 Tie sub-states of a feature state to the corresponding reducers 4 Create a selector to access the 'watchlist' feature state 5 select the watchlistData sub state 6 re-export the selector Note how createSelector allows to chain selectors. This is a powerful tool that also allows for selecting from multiple states. You can use selectors as pipeable operators: watchlist.component.ts export class WatchlistComponent { watchlistItems$: Observable; constructor( private store: Store ) { this.watchlistItems$ = this.store.pipe(select(fromWatchlist.getAllItems)); } } watchlist.component.html Watchlist {{item.movie.title}} ({{item.movie.releaseYear}}): {{item.playbackMinutes}}/{{item.movie.runtimeMinutes}} min watched We track the user’s current progress at watching a movie as the playbackMinutes property. After closing a video, the watched minutes have to be updated. In NgRx, state is being updated by dispatching actions. An action is an option with a (globally unique) type discriminator and an optional payload. Create a file playback/actions/index.ts. In this example, we do not further separate the actions per sub state. Actions can be defined by using action creators: playback/actions/index.ts import { createAction, props, union } from '@ngrx/store'; export const playbackFinished = createAction('[Playback] Playback finished', props()); const actions = union({ playbackFinished }); export type ActionsUnion = typeof actions; First we specify the type, followed by a call to the payload definition function. Next, we create a union of all possible actions for this file using union, which allows us a to access action payloads in the reducer in a typesafe way. Action types should follow the naming convention [Source] Event, e.g. [Recommended List] Hide Recommendation or [Auth API] Login Success. Think of actions rather as events than commands. You should never use the same action at two different places (you can still handle multiple actions the same way). This facilitate tracing the source of an action. For details see Good Action Hygiene with NgRx by Mike Ryan (video). We skip the implementation of an actual video playback page and simulate watching a movie in 10 minute segments by adding a link in the template: watchlist-component.html ... Add 10 Minutes watchlist-component.ts import * as playbackActions from 'src/app/playback/actions'; ... stoppedPlayback(movieId: number, stoppedAtMinute: number) { this.store.dispatch(playbackActions.playbackFinished({ movieId, stoppedAtMinute })); } Next, we handle the action inside the watchlistData reducer. Note that actions can be handled by multiple reducers and effects at the same time to update different states, for example if we’d like to show a rating modal after playback has finished. watchlist-data.reducer.ts export function reducer(state = initialState, action: playbackActions.ActionsUnion): State { switch (action.type) { case playbackActions.playbackFinished.type: return { ...state, items: state.items.map(updatePlaybackMinutesMapper(action.movieId, action.stoppedAtMinute)) }; default: return state; } } export function updatePlaybackMinutesMapper(movieId: number, stoppedAtMinute: number) { return (item: WatchlistItem) => { if (item.movie.id === movieId) { return { ...item, playbackMinutes: stoppedAtMinute }; } else { return item; } }; } Note how we changed the reducer’s function signature to reference the actions union. The switch-case handles all incoming actions to produce the next state. The default case handles all actions a reducer is not interested in by returning the state unchanged. Then we find the watchlist item corresponding to the movie with the given id and update the playback minutes. Since state is immutable, we have to clone all objects down to the one we would like to change using the object spread operator (…​). Selectors rely on object identity to decide whether the value has to be recalculated. Do not clone objects that are not on the path to the change you want to make. This is why updatePlaybackMinutesMapper returns the same item if the movie id does not match. It can be hard to think in immutable changes, especially if your team has a strong background in imperative programming. In this case, you may find the Immer library convenient, which allows to produce immutable objects by manipulating a proxied draft. The same reducer can then be written as: watchlist-data.reducer.ts with Immer import { produce } from 'immer'; ... case playbackActions.playbackFinished.type: return produce(state, draft => { const itemToUpdate = draft.items.find(item => item.movie.id === action.movieId); if (itemToUpdate) { itemToUpdate.playbackMinutes = action.stoppedAtMinute; } }); Immer works out of the box with plain objects and arrays. If the StoreDevToolsModule is instrumented as described above, you can use the browser extension Redux devtools to see all dispatched actions and the resulting state diff, as well as the current state, and even travel back in time by undoing actions.

This guide will show common tasks and best practices. For each feature module and the app module all routes should be defined in a separate module with the suffix RoutingModule. This way the routing modules are the only place where routes are defined. This pattern achieves a clear separation of concerns. The following figure illustrates this. Figure 1. Routing module declaration It is important to define routes inside app routing module with .forRoot() and in feature routing modules with .forChild(). In this example two modules need to be configured with routes - AppModule and FlightModule. The following routes will be configured / will redirect to /search /search displays FlightSearchComponent (FlightModule) /search/print/:flightId/:date displays FlightPrintComponent (FlightModule) /search/details/:flightId/:date displays FlightDetailsComponent (FlightModule) All other routes will display ErrorPage404 (AppModule) app-routing.module.ts const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', redirectTo: 'search', pathMatch: 'full' }, { path: '**', component: ErrorPage404 } ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)], exports: [RouterModule] }) export class AppRoutingModule { } flight-search-routing.module.ts const routes: Routes = [ { path: 'search', children: [ { path: '', component: FlightSearchComponent }, { path: 'print/:flightId/:date', component: FlightPrintComponent }, { path: 'details/:flightId/:date', component: FlightDetailsComponent } ] } ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)], exports: [RouterModule], }) export class FlightSearchRoutingModule { } The import order inside AppModule is important. AppRoutingModule needs to be imported after FlightModule. Lazy Loading is a good practice when the application has multiple feature areas and a user might not visit every dialog. Or at least he might not need every dialog up front. The following example will configure the same routes as example 1 but will lazy load FlightModule. app-routing.module.ts const routes: Routes = [ { path: '/search', loadChildren: 'app/flight-search/flight-search.module#FlightSearchModule' }, { path: '**', component: ErrorPage404 } ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)], exports: [RouterModule] }) export class AppRoutingModule { } flight-search-routing.module.ts const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', children: [ { path: '', component: FlightSearchComponent }, { path: 'print/:flightId/:date', component: FlightPrintComponent }, { path: 'details/:flightId/:date', component: FlightDetailsComponent } ] } ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)], exports: [RouterModule], }) export class FlightSearchRoutingModule { } With Angular you have two ways of triggering route changes. Declarative with bindings in component HTML templates Programmatic with Angular Router service inside component classes On the one hand, architecture-wise it is a much cleaner solution to trigger route changes in Smart Components. This way you have every UI event that should trigger a navigation handled in one place - in a Smart Component. It becomes very easy to look inside the code for every navigation, that can occur. Refactoring is also much easier, as there are no navigation events \"hidden\" in the HTML templates On the other hand, in terms of accessibility and SEO it is a better solution to rely on bindings in the view - e.g. by using Angular router-link directive. This way screen readers and the Google crawler can move through the page easily. If you do not have to support accessibility (screen readers, etc.) and to care about SEO (Google rank, etc.), then you should aim for triggering navigation only in Smart Components. Figure 2. Triggering navigation Guards are Angular services implemented on routes which determines whether a user can navigate to/from the route. There are examples below which will explain things better. We have the following types of Guards: CanActivate: It is used to determine whether a user can visit a route. The most common scenario for this guard is to check if the user is authenticated. For example, if we want only logged in users to be able to go to a particular route, we will implement the CanActivate guard on this route. CanActivateChild: Same as above, only implemented on child routes. CanDeactivate: It is used to determine if a user can navigate away from a route. Most common example is when a user tries to go to a different page after filling up a form and does not save/submit the changes, we can use this guard to confirm whether the user really wants to leave the page without saving/submitting. Resolve: For resolving dynamic data. CanLoad: It is used to determine whether an Angular module can be loaded lazily. Example below will be helpful to understand it. Let’s have a look at some examples. As mentioned earlier, a guard is an Angular service and services are simply TypeScript classes. So we begin by creating a class. This class has to implement the CanActivate interface (imported from angular/router), and therefore, must have a canActivate function. The logic of this function determines whether the requested route can be navigated to or not. It returns either a Boolean value or an Observable or a Promise which resolves to a Boolean value. If it is true, the route is loaded, else not. CanActivate example ... import {CanActivate} from \"@angular/router\"; @Injectable() class ExampleAuthGuard implements CanActivate { constructor(private authService: AuthService) {} canActivate(route: ActivatedRouterSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot) { if (this.authService.isLoggedIn()) { return true; } else { window.alert('Please log in first'); return false; } } } In the above example, let’s assume we have a AuthService which has a isLoggedIn() method which returns a Boolean value depending on whether the user is logged in. We use it to return true or false from the canActivate function. The canActivate function accepts two parameters (provided by Angular). The first parameter of type ActivatedRouterSnapshot is the snapshot of the route the user is trying to navigate to (where the guard is implemented); we can extract the route parameters from this instance. The second parameter of type RouterStateSnapshot is a snapshot of the router state the user is trying to navigate to; we can fetch the URL from it’s url property. We can also redirect the user to another page (maybe a login page) if the authService returns false. To do that, inject Router and use it’s navigate function to redirect to the appropriate page. Since it is a service, it needs to be provided in our module: provide the guard in a module @NgModule({ ... providers: [ ... ExampleAuthGuard ] }) Now this guard is ready to use on our routes. We implement it where we define our array of routes in the application: Implementing the guard ... const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' }, { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent }, { path: 'page1', component: Page1Component, canActivate: [ExampleAuthGuard] } ]; As you can see, the canActivate property accepts an array of guards. So we can implement more than one guard on a route. To use the guard on nested (children) routes, we add it to the canActivateChild property like so: Implementing the guard on child routes ... const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' }, { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent }, { path: 'page1', component: Page1Component, canActivateChild: [ExampleAuthGuard], children: [ {path: 'sub-page1', component: SubPageComponent}, {path: 'sub-page2', component: SubPageComponent} ] } ]; Similar to CanActivate, to use this guard we implement the CanLoad interface and overwrite it’s canLoad function. Again, this function returns either a Boolean value or an Observable or a Promise which resolves to a Boolean value. The fundamental difference between CanActivate and CanLoad is that CanLoad is used to determine whether an entire module can be lazily loaded or not. If the guard returns false for a module protected by CanLoad, the entire module is not loaded. CanLoad example ... import {CanLoad, Route} from \"@angular/router\"; @Injectable() class ExampleCanLoadGuard implements CanLoad { constructor(private authService: AuthService) {} canLoad(route: Route) { if (this.authService.isLoggedIn()) { return true; } else { window.alert('Please log in first'); return false; } } } Again, let’s assume we have a AuthService which has a isLoggedIn() method which returns a Boolean value depending on whether the user is logged in. The canLoad function accepts a parameter of type Route which we can use to fetch the path a user is trying to navigate to (using the path property of Route). This guard needs to be provided in our module like any other service. To implement the guard, we use the canLoad property: Implementing the guard ... const routes: Routes = [ { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent }, { path: 'admin', loadChildren: 'app/admin/admin.module#AdminModule', canLoad: [ExampleCanLoadGuard] } ];","title":"Routing","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guide-routing","url":"/typescript/current/angular/guide-routing.html","titles":[{"text":"Defining Routes","hash":"_defining_routes","id":1},{"text":"Example 1 - No Lazy Loading","hash":"_example_1_no_lazy_loading","id":2},{"text":"Example 2 - Lazy Loading","hash":"_example_2_lazy_loading","id":3},{"text":"Triggering Route Changes","hash":"_triggering_route_changes","id":4},{"text":"Guards","hash":"_guards","id":5},{"text":"Example 1 - CanActivate and CanActivateChild guards","hash":"_example_1_canactivate_and_canactivatechild_guards","id":6},{"text":"CanActivate guard","hash":"_canactivate_guard","id":7},{"text":"CanActivateChild guard","hash":"_canactivatechild_guard","id":8},{"text":"Example 2 - CanLoad guard","hash":"_example_2_canload_guard","id":9}]},"54":{"id":54,"text":"This guide will cover the basics of testing logic inside your code with unit test cases. The guide assumes that you are familiar with Angular CLI (see the guide) For testing your Angular application with unit test cases there are two main strategies: Isolated unit test cases Isolated unit tests examine an instance of a class all by itself without any dependence on Angular or any injected values. The amount of code and effort needed to create such tests in minimal. Angular Testing Utilities Let you test components including their interaction with Angular. The amount of code and effort needed to create such tests is a little higher. The following figure shows you an overview of the application architecture divided in testing areas. Figure 1. Testing Areas There are three areas, which need to be covered by different testing strategies. Components: Smart Components need to be tested because they contain view logic. Also the interaction with 3rd party components needs to be tested. When a 3rd party component changes with an upgrade a test will be failing and warn you, that there is something wrong with the new version. Most of the time Dumb Components do not need to be tested because they mainly display data and do not contain any logic. Smart Components are always tested with Angular Testing Utilities. For example selectors, which select data from the store and transform it further, need to be tested. Stores: A store contains methods representing state transitions. If these methods contain logic, they need to be tested. Stores are always tested using Isolated unit tests. Services: Services contain Business Logic, which needs to be tested. UseCase Services represent a whole business use case. For instance this could be initializing a store with all the data that is needed for a dialog - loading, transforming, storing. Often Angular Testing Utilities are the optimal solution for testing UseCase Services, because they allow for an easy stubbing of the back-end. All other services should be tested with Isolated unit tests as they are much easier to write and maintain. Testing Smart Components should assure the following. Bindings are correct. Selectors which load data from the store are correct. Asynchronous behavior is correct (loading state, error state, \"normal\" state). Oftentimes through testing one realizes, that important edge cases are forgotten. Do these test become very complex, it is often an indicator for poor code quality in the component. Then the implementation is to be adjusted / refactored. When testing values received from the native DOM, you will test also that 3rd party libraries did not change with a version upgrade. A failing test will show you what part of a 3rd party library has changed. This is much better than the users doing this for you. For example a binding might fail because the property name was changed with a newer version of a 3rd party library. In the function beforeEach() the TestBed imported from Angular Testing Utilities needs to be initialized. The goal should be to define a minimal test-module with TestBed. The following code gives you an example. Example test setup for Smart Components describe('PrintFlightComponent', () => { let fixture: ComponentFixture; let store: FlightStore; let printServiceSpy: jasmine.SpyObj; beforeEach(() => { const urlParam = '1337'; const activatedRouteStub = { params: of({ id: urlParam }) }; printServiceSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj('FlightPrintService', ['initializePrintDialog']); TestBed.configureTestingModule({ imports: [ TranslateModule.forRoot(), RouterTestingModule ], declarations: [ PrintFlightComponent, PrintContentComponent, GeneralInformationPrintPanelComponent, PassengersPrintPanelComponent ], providers: [ FlightStore, {provide: FlightPrintService, useValue: printServiceSpy}, {provide: ActivatedRoute, useValue: activatedRouteStub} ] }); fixture = TestBed.createComponent(PrintFlightComponent); store = fixture.debugElement.injector.get(FlightStore); fixture.detectChanges(); }); // ... test cases }) It is important: Use RouterTestingModule instead of RouterModule Use TranslateModule.forRoot() without translations This way you can test language-neutral without translation marks. Do not add a whole module from your application - in declarations add the tested Smart Component with all its Dumb Components The store should never be stubbed. If you need a complex test setup, just use the regular methods defined on the store. Stub all services used by the Smart Component. These are mostly UseCase services. They should not be tested by these tests. Only the correct call to their functions should be assured. The logic inside the UseCase services is tested with separate tests. detectChanges() performance an Angular Change Detection cycle (Angular refreshes all the bindings present in the view) tick() performance a virtual macro task, tick(1000) is equal to the virtual passing of 1s. The following test cases show the testing strategy in action. Example it('calls initializePrintDialog for url parameter 1337', fakeAsync(() => { expect(printServiceSpy.initializePrintDialog).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1337); })); it('creates correct loading subtitle', fakeAsync(() => { store.setPrintStateLoading(123); tick(); fixture.detectChanges(); const subtitle = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('app-header-element .print-header-container span:last-child')); expect(subtitle.nativeElement.textContent).toBe('PRINT_HEADER.FLIGHT STATE.IS_LOADING'); })); it('creates correct subtitle for loaded flight', fakeAsync(() => { store.setPrintStateLoadedSuccess({ id: 123, description: 'Description', iata: 'FRA', name: 'Frankfurt', // ... }); tick(); fixture.detectChanges(); const subtitle = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('app-header-element .print-header-container span:last-child')); expect(subtitle.nativeElement.textContent).toBe('PRINT_HEADER.FLIGHT \"FRA (Frankfurt)\" (ID: 123)'); })); The examples show the basic testing method Set the store to a well-defined state check if the component displays the correct values …​ via checking values inside the native DOM. Stores are always tested with Isolated unit tests. Actions triggered by dispatchAction() calls are asynchronously performed to alter the state. A good solution to test such a state transition is to use the done callback from Jasmine. Example for testing a store let sut: FlightStore; beforeEach(() => { sut = new FlightStore(); }); it('setPrintStateLoading sets print state to loading', (done: Function) => { sut.setPrintStateLoading(4711); sut.state$.pipe(first()).subscribe(result => { expect(result.print.isLoading).toBe(true); expect(result.print.loadingId).toBe(4711); done(); }); }); it('toggleRowChecked adds flight with given id to selectedValues Property', (done: Function) => { const flight: FlightTO = { id: 12 // dummy data }; sut.setRegisterabgleichListe([flight]); sut.toggleRowChecked(12); sut.state$.pipe(first()).subscribe(result => { expect(result.selectedValues).toContain(flight); done(); }); }); When testing services both strategies - Isolated unit tests and Angular Testing Utilities - are valid options. The goal of such tests are assuring the behavior for valid data. assuring the behavior for invalid data. documenting functionality save performing refactoring thinking about edge case behavior while testing For simple services Isolated unit tests can be written. Writing these tests takes lesser effort and they can be written very fast. The following listing gives an example of such tests. Testing a simple services with Isolated unit tests let sut: IsyDatePipe; beforeEach(() => { sut = new IsyDatePipe(); }); it('transform should return empty string if input value is empty', () => { expect(sut.transform('')).toBe(''); }); it('transform should return empty string if input value is null', () => { expect(sut.transform(undefined)).toBe(''); }); // ...more tests For testing Use Case services the Angular Testing Utilities should be used. The following listing gives an example. Test setup for testing use case services with Angular Testing Utilities let sut: FlightPrintService; let store: FlightStore; let httpController: HttpTestingController; let flightCalculationServiceStub: jasmine.SpyObj; const flight: FlightTo = { // ... valid dummy data }; beforeEach(() => { flightCalculationServiceStub = jasmine.createSpyObj('FlightCalculationService', ['getFlightType']); flightCalculationServiceStub.getFlightType.and.callFake((catalog: string, type: string, key: string) => of(`${key}_long`)); TestBed.configureTestingModule({ imports: [ HttpClientTestingModule, RouterTestingModule, ], providers: [ FlightPrintService, FlightStore, FlightAdapter, {provide: FlightCalculationService, useValue: flightCalculationServiceStub} ] }); sut = TestBed.get(FlightPrintService); store = TestBed.get(FlightStore); httpController = TestBed.get(HttpTestingController); }); When using TestBed, it is important to import HttpClientTestingModule for stubbing the back-end to import RouterTestingModule for stubbing the Angular router not to stub stores, adapters and business services to stub services from libraries like FlightCalculationService - the correct implementation of libraries should not be tested by these tests. Testing back-end communication looks like this: Testing back-end communication with Angular HttpTestingController it('loads flight if not present in store', fakeAsync(() => { sut.initializePrintDialog(1337); const processRequest = httpController.expectOne('/path/to/flight'); processRequest.flush(flight); httpController.verify(); })); it('does not load flight if present in store', fakeAsync(() => { const flight = {...flight, id: 4711}; store.setRegisterabgleich(flight); sut.initializePrintDialog(4711); httpController.expectNone('/path/to/flight'); httpController.verify(); })); The first test assures a correct XHR request is performed if initializePrintDialog() is called and no data is in the store. The second test assures no XHR request IST performed if the needed data is already in the store. The next steps are checks for the correct implementation of logic. Example testing a Use Case service it('creates flight destination for valid key in svz', fakeAsync(() => { const flightTo: FlightTo = { ...flight, id: 4712, profile: '77' }; store.setFlight(flightTo); let result: FlightPrintContent|undefined; sut.initializePrintDialog(4712); store.select(s => s.print.content).subscribe(content => result = content); tick(); expect(result!.destination).toBe('77_long (ID: 77)'); }));","title":"Testing","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guide-testing","url":"/typescript/current/angular/guide-testing.html","titles":[{"text":"Testing Concept","hash":"_testing_concept","id":1},{"text":"Testing Smart Components","hash":"_testing_smart_components","id":2},{"text":"Testing state transitions performed by stores","hash":"_testing_state_transitions_performed_by_stores","id":3},{"text":"Testing services","hash":"_testing_services","id":4}]},"55":{"id":55,"text":"There are constant updates for the official Angular framework dependencies.

It will check even if the update is not possible as there is another library or libraries that are not compatible with the versions of the upgraded dependencies. In this case it will keep your application untouched. The repository must be in a clean state before executing a ng update. So, remember to commit your changes first. In order to perform a basic upgrade we will execute: $ ng update @angular/cli @angular/core The process will be the same, but first we need to make sure that our devon4ng application is in the lates version of Angular 8, so the ng update command can perform the upgrade not only in the dependencies but also making code changes to reflect the new features and fixes. First, upgrade to latest Angular 9 version: $ ng update @angular/cli@9 @angular/core@9 Optionally the flag -C can be added to previous command to make a commit automatically. This is also valid for the next steps. Then, upgrade Angular: $ ng update @angular/cli @angular/core In case you use Angular Material: $ ng update @angular/material If the application depends on third party libraries, the new tool ngcc can be run to make them compatible with the new Ivy compiler. In this case it is recommended to include a postinstall script in the package.json: { \"scripts\": { \"postinstall\": \"ngcc --properties es2015 browser module main --first-only --create-ivy-entry-points\" } } More information at https://angular.io/guide/ivy. Important use cases: To update to the next beta or pre-release version, use the --next=true option. To update from one major version to another, use the format ng update @angular/cli@^ @angular/core@^. In case your Angular application uses @angular/material include it in the first command: $ ng update @angular/cli @angular/core @angular/material Just following the same procedure we can upgrade Angular applications, but we must take care of important specific Ionic dependencies: $ ng update @angular/cli @angular/core @ionic/angular @ionic/angular-toolkit [@ionic/...] Every application will make use of different dependencies. Angular CLI ng upgrade will also take care of these ones. For example, if you need to upgrade @capacitor you will perform: $ ng update @capacitor/cli @capacitor/core [@capacitor/...] Another example could be that you need to upgrade @ngx-translate packages.

Under the hood Angular CLI uses specific tools to achieve these tasks. The user does no need to maintain them and can rely on Angular to keep them up to date and maybe switch to other tools which come up in the future. The Angular CLI provides a wiki with common tasks you encounter when working on applications with the Angular CLI. The Angular CLI Wiki can be found here. In this guide we will go through the most important tasks. To go into more details, please visit the Angular CLI wiki. Angular CLI should be added as global and local dependency. The following commands add Angular CLI as global Dependency. yarn command yarn global add @angular/cli npm command npm install -g @angular/cli You can check a successful installtion with ng --version. This should print out the version installed. Figure 1. Printing Angular CLI Version The Angular CLI can be used to start a live development server. First your application will be compiled and then the server will be started. If you change the code of a file, the server will reload the displayed page. Run your application with the following command: ng serve -o All unit tests can be executed with the command: ng test To make a single run and create a code coverage file use the following command: ng test -sr -cc You can configure the output format for code coverage files to match your requirements in the file karma.conf.js which can be found on toplevel of your project folder. For instance, this can be useful for exporting the results to a SonarQube. You can lint your files with the command ng lint --type-check You can adjust the linting rules in the file tslint.json which can be found on toplevel of your project folder. For creating a new Angular CLI project the command ng new is used. The following command creates a new application named my-app. ng create my-app A new feature module can be created via ng generate module` command. The following command generates a new feature module named todo. ng generate module todo Figure 2. Generate a module with Angular CLI The created feature module needs to be added to the AppModule by hand. Other option would be to define a lazy route in AppRoutingModule to make this a lazy loaded module. To create components the command ng generate component can be used. The following command will generate the component todo-details inside the components layer of todo module. It will generate a class, a html file, a css file and a test file. Also, it will register this component as declaration inside the nearest module - this ist TodoModule. ng generate component todo/components/todo-details Figure 3. Generate a component with Angular CLI If you want to export the component, you have to add the component to exports array of the module. This would be the case if you generate a component inside shared module. Inside an Angular CLI project the file .angular-cli.json can be used to configure the Angular CLI. The following options are very important to understand. The property defaults` can be used to change the default style extension. The following settings will make the Angular CLI generate .less files, when a new component is generated. \"defaults\": { \"styleExt\": \"less\", \"component\": {} } The property apps contains all applications maintained with Angular CLI. Most of the time you will have only one. assets configures all the static files, that the application needs - this can be images, fonts, json files, etc. When you add them to assets the Angular CLI will put these files to the build target and serve them while debugging. The following will put all files in /i18n to the output folder /i18n \"assets\": [ { \"glob\": \"**/*.json\", \"input\": \"./i18n\", \"output\": \"./i18n\" } ] styles property contains all style files that will be globally available. The Angular CLI will create a styles bundle that goes directly into index.html with it. The following will make all styles in styles.less globally available. \"styles\": [ \"styles.less\" ] environmentSource and environments are used to configure configuration with the Angular CLI. Inside the code always the file specified in environmentSource will be referenced. You can define different environments - eg. production, staging, etc. - which you list in enviroments.

Sometimes the client is more complex to develop and design than the server. While the server architecture is nowadays easily to agree as common sense, for clients this is not as obvious and stable especially as it typically depends on the client framework used. Finding a concrete architecture applicable for all clients may therefore be difficult to accomplish. This document tries to define on a high abstract level, a reference architecture which is supposed to be a mental image and frame for orientation regarding the evaluation and appliance of different client frameworks. As such it defines terms and concepts required to be provided for in any framework and thus gives a common ground of understanding for those acquainted with the reference architecture. This allows better comparison between the various frameworks out there, each having their own terms for essentially the same concepts. It also means that for each framework we need to explicitly map how it implements the concepts defined in this document. The architecture proposed herein is neither new nor was it developed from scratch. Instead it is the gathered and consolidated knowledge and best practices of various projects (s. References). The goal of the client architecture is to support the non-functional requirements for the client, i.e. mostly maintainability, scalability, efficiency and portability. As such it provides a component-oriented architecture following the same principles listed already in the devonfw architecture overview. Furthermore it ensures a homogeneity regarding how different concrete UI technologies are being applied in the projects, solving the common requirements in the same way. As for the server we distinguish between the business and the technical architecture. Where the business architecture is different from project to project and relates to the concrete design of dialog components given concrete requirements, the technical architecture can be applied to multiple projects. The focus of this document is to provide a technical reference architecture on the client on a very abstract level defining required layers and components. How the architecture is implemented has to be defined for each UI technology. The technical infrastructure architecture is out of scope for this document and although it needs to be considered, the concepts of the reference architecture should work across multiple TI architecture, i.e. native or web clients. The following gives a complete overview of the proposed reference architecture. It will be built up incrementally in the following sections. Figure 1 Overview On the highest level of abstraction we see the need to differentiate between dialog components and their container they are managed in, as well as the access to the application server being the back-end for the client (e.g. an devon4j instance). This section gives a summary of these components and how they relate to each other. Detailed architectures for each component will be supplied in subsequent sections Figure 2 Overview of Client Architecture A dialog component is a logical, self-contained part of the user interface. It accepts user input and actions and controls communication with the user. Dialog components use the services provided by the dialog container in order to execute the business logic. They are self-contained, i.e. they possess their own user interface together with the associated logic, data and states. Dialog components can be composed of other dialog components forming a hierarchy Dialog components can interact with each other. This includes communication of a parent to its children, but also between components independent of each other regarding the hierarchy. Dialog components need to be managed in their life-cycle and how they can be coupled to each other. The dialog container is responsible for this along with the following: Bootstrapping the client application and environment Configuration of the client Initialization of the application server access component Dialog Component Management Controlling the life-cycle Controlling the dialog flow Providing means of interaction between the dialogs Providing application server access Providing services to the dialog components (e.g. printing, caching, data storage) Shutdown of the application Dialogs will require a back-end application server in order to execute their business logic. Typically in an devonfw application the service layer will provide interfaces for the functionality exposed to the client. These business oriented interfaces should also be present on the client backed by a proxy handling the concrete call of the server over the network. This component provides the set of interfaces as well as the proxy. The dialog container can be further structured into the following components with their respective tasks described in own sections: Figure 3 Dialog Container Architecture The application component represents the overall client in our architecture. It is responsible for bootstrapping all other components and connecting them with each other. As such it initializes the components below and provides an environment for them to work in. The configuration management manages the configuration of the client, so the client can be deployed in different environments. This includes configuration of the concrete application server to be called or any other environment-specific property. The Dialog Management component provides the means to define, create and destroy dialog components. It therefore offers basic life-cycle capabilities for a component. In addition it also allows composition of dialog components in a hierarchy. The life-cycle is then managed along the hierarchy, meaning when creating/destroying a parent dialog, this affects all child components, which are created/destroyed as well. Apart from dialog components, a client application also consists of services offered to these. A service can thereby encompass among others: Access to the application server Access to the dialog container functions for managing dialogs or accessing the configuration Dialog independent client functionality such as Printing, Caching, Logging, Encapsulated business logic such as tax calculation Dialog component interaction The service registry offers the possibility to define, register and lookup these services. Note that these services could be dependent on the dialog hierarchy, meaning different child instances could obtain different instances / implementations of a service via the service registry, depending on which service implementations are registered by the parents. Services should be defined as interfaces allowing for different implementations and thus loose coupling. A dialog component has to support all or a subset of the following tasks: (T1) Displaying the user interface incl. internationalization (T2) Displaying business data incl. changes made to the data due to user interactions and localization of the data (T3) Accepting user input including possible conversion from e.g. entered Text to an Integer (T4) Displaying the dialog state (T5) Validation of user input (T6) Managing the business data incl. business logic altering it due to user interactions (T7) Execution of user interactions (T8) Managing the state of the dialog (e.g. Edit vs. View) (T9) Calling the application server in the course of user interactions Following the principle of separation of concerns, we further structure a dialog component in an own architecture allowing us the distribute responsibility for these tasks along the defined components: Figure 4 Overview of dialog component architecture The presentation layer generates and displays the user interface, accepts user input and user actions and binds these to the dialog core layer (T1-5). The tasks of the presentation layer fall into two categories: Provision of the visual representation (View component) The presentation layer generates and displays the user interface and accepts user input and user actions. The logical processing of the data, actions and states is performed in the dialog core layer. The data and user interface are displayed in localized and internationalized form. Binding of the visual representation to the dialog core layer The presentation layer itself does not contain any dialog logic. The data or actions entered by the user are then processed in the dialog core layer. There are three aspects to the binding to the dialog core layer. We refer to “data binding”, “state binding” and “action binding”. Syntactical and (to a certain extent) semantic validations are performed during data binding (e.g. cross-field plausibility checks). Furthermore, the formatted, localized data in the presentation layer is converted into the presentation-independent, neutral data in the dialog core layer (parsing) and vice versa (formatting). The dialog core layer contains the business logic, the control logic, and the logical state of the dialog. It therefore covers tasks T5-9: Maintenance of the logical dialog state and the logical data The dialog core layer maintains the logical dialog state and the logical data in a form which is independent of the presentation. The states of the presentation (e.g. individual widgets) must not be maintained in the dialog core layer, e.g. the view state could lead to multiple presentation states disabling all editable widgets on the view. Implementation of the dialog and dialog control logic The component parts in the dialog core layer implement the client specific business logic and the dialog control logic. This includes, for example, the manipulation of dialog data and dialog states as well as the opening and closing of dialogs. Communication with the application server The dialog core layer calls the interfaces of the application server via the application server access component services. The dialog core layer should not depend on the presentation layer enforcing a strict layering and thus minimizing dependencies. Dialog components can interact in the following ways: Embedding of dialog components As already said dialog components can be hierarchically composed. This composition works by embedding on dialog component within the other. Apart from the life-cycle managed by the dialog container, the embedding needs to cope for the visual embedding of the presentation and core layer. Embedding dialog presentation The parent dialog needs to either integrate the embedded dialog in its layout or open it in an own model window. Embedding dialog core The parent dialog needs to be able to access the embedded instance of its children. This allows initializing and changing their data and states. On the other hand the children might require context information offered by the parent dialog by registering services in the hierarchical service registry. Dialog flow Apart from the embedding of dialog components representing a tight coupling, dialogs can interact with each other by passing the control of the UI, i.e. switching from one dialog to another. When interacting, dialog components should interact only between the same or lower layers, i.e. the dialog core should not access the presentation layer of another dialog component. The Quasar client architecture as the consolidated knowledge of our CSD projects is the major source for the above drafted architecture. However, the above is a much simplified and more agile version thereof: Quasar Client tried to abstract from the concrete UI library being used, so it could decouple the business from the technical logic of a dialog. The presentation layer should be the only one knowing the concrete UI framework used. This level of abstraction was dropped in this reference architecture, although it might of course still make sense in some projects. For fast-moving agile projects in the web however introducing such a level of abstraction takes effort with little gained benefits. With frameworks like Angular 2 we would even introduce one additional seemingly artificial and redundant layer, since it already separates the dialog core from its presentation. In the past and in the days of Struts, JSF, etc. the concept of session handling was important for the client since part of the client was sitting on a server with a session relating it to its remote counterpart on the users PC. Quasar Client catered for this need, by very prominently differentiating between session and application in the root of the dialog component hierarchy. However, in the current days of SPA applications and the lowered importance of servers-side web clients, this prominent differentiation was dropped. When still needed the referenced documents will provide in more detail how to tailor the respective architecture to this end.

It is the layer where the business logic is placed. The main challenges are: Define application state and an API for the components layer to use it Handle application state transitions Perform back-end interaction (XHR, WebSocket, etc.) Handle business logic in a maintainable way Configuration management All parts of the services layer are described in this chapter. An example which puts the concepts together can be found at the end Interaction of Smart Components through the services layer. There are two APIs for the components layer to interact with the services layer: A store can be subscribed to for receiving state updates over time A use case service can be called to trigger an action To illustrate the fact the following figure shows an abstract overview. Figure 1. Boundaries to components layer A store is a class which defines and handles application state with its transitions over time. Interaction with a store is always synchronous. A basic implementation using RxJS can look like this. A more profound implementation taken from a real-life project can be found here (Abstract Class Store). Store defined using RxJS @Injectable() export class ProductSearchStore { private stateSource = new BehaviorSubject(defaultProductSearchState); state$ = this.stateSource.asObservable(); setLoading(isLoading: boolean) { const currentState = this.stateSource.getValue(); this.stateSource.next({ isLoading: isLoading, products: currentState.products, searchCriteria: currentState.searchCriteria }); } } In the example ProductSearchStore handles state of type ProductSearchState. The public API is the property state$ which is an observable of type ProductSearchState. The state can be changed with method calls. So every desired change to the state needs to be modeled with an method. In reactive terminology this would be an Action. The store does not use any services. Subscribing to the state$ observable leads to the subscribers receiving every new state. This is basically the Observer Pattern: The store consumer registers itself to the observable via state$.subscribe() method call. The first parameter of subscribe() is a callback function to be called when the subject changes. This way the consumer - the observer - is registered. When next() is called with a new state inside the store, all callback functions are called with the new value. So every observer is notified of the state change. This equals the Observer Pattern push type. A store is the API for Smart Components to receive state from the service layer. State transitions are handled automatically with Smart Components registering to the state$ observable. A use case service is a service which has methods to perform asynchronous state transitions. In reactive terminology this would be an Action of Actions - a thunk (redux) or an effect (@ngrx). Figure 2. Use case services are the main API to trigger state transitions A use case services method - an action - interacts with adapters, business services and stores. So use case services orchestrate whole use cases. For an example see use case service example. An adapter is used to communicate with the back-end. This could be a simple XHR request, a WebSocket connection, etc. An adapter is simple in the way that it does not add anything other than the pure network call. So there is no caching or logging performed here. The following listing shows an example. For further information on back-end interaction see Consuming REST Services Calling the back-end via an adapter @Injectable() export class ProducsAdapter { private baseUrl = environment.baseUrl; constructor(private http: HttpClient) { } getAll(): Observable { return this.http.get(this.baseUrl + '/products'); } } The interaction of smart components is a classic problem which has to be solved in every UI technology. It is basically how one dialog tells the other something has changed. An example is adding an item to the shopping basket. With this action there need to be multiple state updates. The small logo showing how many items are currently inside the basket needs to be updated from 0 to 1 The price needs to be recalculated Shipping costs need to be checked Discounts need to be updated Ads need to be updated with related products etc. To handle this interaction in a scalable way we apply the following pattern. Figure 3. Smart Component interaction The state of interest is encapsulated inside a store. All Smart Components interested in the state have to subscribe to the store’s API served by the public observable. Thus, with every update to the store the subscribed components receive the new value. The components basically react to state changes. Altering a store can be done directly if the desired change is synchronous. Most actions are of asynchronous nature so the UseCaseService comes into play. Its actions are void methods, which implement a use case, i.e., adding a new item to the basket. It calls asynchronous actions and can perform multiple store updates over time. To put this pattern into perspective the UseCaseService is a programmatic alternative to redux-thunk or @ngrx/effects. The main motivation here is to use the full power of TypeScript --strictNullChecks and to let the learning curve not to become as steep as it would be when learning a new state management framework. This way actions are just void method calls. Figure 4. Smart Components interaction example The example shows two Smart Components sharing the FlightSearchState by using the FlightSearchStore. The use case shown is started by an event in the Smart Component FlightSearchComponent. The action loadFlight() is called. This could be submitting a search form. The UseCaseService is FlightSearchService, which handles the use case Load Flights. UseCaseService example export class FlightSearchService { constructor( private flightSearchAdapter: FlightSearchAdapter, private store: FlightSearchStore ) { } loadFlights(criteria: FlightSearchCriteria): void { this.store.setLoadingFlights(true); this.store.clearFlights(); this.flightSearchAdapter.getFlights(criteria.departureDate, { from: criteria.departureAirport, to: criteria.destinationAirport }) .finally(() => this.store.setLoadingFlights(false)) .subscribe((result: FlightTo[]) => this.store.setFlights(result, criteria)); } } First the loading flag is set to true and the current flights are cleared. This leads the Smart Component showing a spinner indicating the loading action. Then the asynchronous XHR is triggered by calling the adapter. After completion the loading flag is set to false causing the loading indication no longer to be shown. If the XHR was successful, the data would be put into the store. If the XHR was not successful, this would be the place to handle a custom error. All general network issues should be handled in a dedicated class, i.e., an interceptor. So for example the basic handling of 404 errors is not done here.","title":"Services Layer","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"services-layer","url":"/typescript/current/angular/services-layer.html","titles":[{"text":"Boundaries","hash":"_boundaries","id":1},{"text":"Store","hash":"_store","id":2},{"text":"Use Case Service","hash":"_use_case_service","id":3},{"text":"Adapter","hash":"_adapter","id":4},{"text":"Interaction of Smart Components through the services layer","hash":"_interaction_of_smart_components_through_the_services_layer","id":5},{"text":"Pattern","hash":"_pattern","id":6},{"text":"Example","hash":"_example","id":7}]},"62":{"id":62,"text":"This section introduces concepts to help developers with the tooling and package managers.","title":"","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"general","url":"/typescript/current/general/general.html","titles":[]},"63":{"id":63,"text":"nvm is a version manager for node.js, designed to be installed per-user, and invoked per-shell. nvm works on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), in particular on these platforms: unix, macOS, and windows WSL. To install or update nvm, you should run the install script. To do that, you may either download and run the script manually, or use the following cURL or Wget command: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash Running either of the above commands downloads a script and runs it. The script clones the nvm repository to ~/.nvm, and attempts to add the source lines from the snippet below to the correct profile file (~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc). More info at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install—​update-script. Uninstall any pre-existing node.js installation. Windows users should use the Windows installer. nvm-windows is similar to nvm but not identical. The installer can be downloaded from here. More info at https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows. To download, compile, and install the latest release of node, do this: nvm install node # \"node\" is an alias for the latest version To install a specific version of node: nvm install 14.7.0 # or 16.3.0, 12.22.1, etc The first version installed becomes the default. New shells will start with the default version of node (e.g., nvm alias default). We recommend to install and make it default the latest node.js LTS version. nvm install --lts nvm alias default lts/* # \"lts/*\" is an alias for the latest LTS version More info at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage. You can create a .nvmrc file containing a node version number (or any other string that nvm understands; see nvm --help for details) in the project root directory (or any parent directory). Afterwards, nvm use, nvm install, nvm exec, nvm run, and nvm which will use the version specified in the .nvmrc file if no version is supplied on the command line. For example, to make nvm default to the latest 5.9 release, the latest LTS version, or the latest node version for the current directory: $ echo \"5.9\" > .nvmrc $ echo \"lts/*\" > .nvmrc # to default to the latest LTS version $ echo \"node\" > .nvmrc # to default to the latest version NB these examples assume a POSIX-compliant shell version of echo. If you use a Windows cmd development environment, eg the .nvmrc file is used to configure a remote Linux deployment, then keep in mind the `\"`s will be copied leading to an invalid file. Remove them. Then when you run nvm: $ nvm use Found '/path/to/project/.nvmrc' with version Now using node v5.9.1 (npm v3.7.3) nvm use et. al. will traverse directory structure upwards from the current directory looking for the .nvmrc file. In other words, running nvm use et. al. in any subdirectory of a directory with an .nvmrc will result in that .nvmrc being utilized. The contents of a .nvmrc file must be the (as described by nvm --help) followed by a newline.

Projects in NodeJS make use of modules, chunks of reusable code made by other people or teams. These small chunks of reusable code are called packages [1]. Packages are used to solve specific problems or tasks. These relations between your project and the external packages are called dependencies. For example, imagine we are doing a small program that takes your birthday as an input and tells you how many days are left until your birthday. We search in the repository if someone has published a package to retrieve the actual date and manage date types, and maybe we could search for another package to show a calendar, because we want to optimize our time, and we wish the user to click a calendar button and choose the day in the calendar instead of typing it. As you can see, packages are convenient. In some cases, they may be even needed, as they can manage aspects of your program you may not be proficient in, or provide an easier use of them. For more comprehensive information visit npm definition Dependencies in your project are stored in a file called package.json. Every package.json must contain, at least, the name and version of your project. Package.json is located in the root of your project. If package.json is not on your root directory refer to Problems you may encounter section If you wish to learn more information about package.json, click on the following links: Yarn Package.json npm Package.json As you noticed, package.json is a really important file in your project. It contains essential information about our project, therefore you need to understand what’s inside. The structure of package.json is divided in blocks, inside the first one you can find essential information of your project such as the name, version, license and optionally some Scripts. { \"name\": \"exampleproject\", \"version\": \"0.0.0\", \"license\": \"MIT\", \"scripts\": { \"ng\": \"ng\", \"start\": \"ng serve\", \"build\": \"ng build\", \"test\": \"ng test\", \"lint\": \"ng lint\", \"e2e\": \"ng e2e\" } The next block is called dependencies and contains the packages that project needs in order to be developed, compiled and executed. \"private\": true, \"dependencies\": { \"@angular/animations\": \"^4.2.4\", \"@angular/common\": \"^4.2.4\", \"@angular/forms\": \"^4.2.4\", ... \"zone.js\": \"^0.8.14\" } After dependencies we find devDependencies, another kind of dependencies present in the development of the application but unnecessary for its execution. One example is typescript. Code is written in typescript, and then, transpiled to JavaScript. This means the application is not using typescript in execution and consequently not included in the deployment of our application. \"devDependencies\": { \"@angular/cli\": \"1.4.9\", \"@angular/compiler-cli\": \"^4.2.4\", ... \"@types/node\": \"~6.0.60\", \"typescript\": \"~2.3.3\" } Having a peer dependency means that your package needs a dependency that is the same exact dependency as the person installing your package \"peerDependencies\": { \"package-123\": \"^2.7.18\" } Optional dependencies are just that: optional. If they fail to install, Yarn will still say the install process was successful. \"optionalDependencies\": { \"package-321\": \"^2.7.18\" } Finally you can have bundled dependencies which are packages bundled together when publishing your package in a repository. { \"bundledDependencies\": [ \"package-4\" ] } Here is the link to an in-depth explanation of dependency types​. Scripts are a great way of automating tasks related to your package, such as simple build processes or development tools. For example: { \"name\": \"exampleproject\", \"version\": \"0.0.0\", \"license\": \"MIT\", \"scripts\": { \"build-project\": \"node hello-world.js\", } You can run that script by running the command yarn (run) script or npm run script, check the example below: $ yarn (run) build-project # run is optional $ npm run build-project There are special reserved words for scripts, like pre-install, which will execute the script automatically before the package you install are installed. Check different uses for scripts in the following links: Yarn scripts documentation npm scripts documentation Or you can go back to Content of package.json​. In order to manage dependencies we recommend using package managers in your projects. A big reason is their usability. Adding or removing a package is really easy, and by doing so, packet manager update the package.json and copies (or removes) the package in the needed location, with a single command. Another reason, closely related to the first one, is reducing human error by automating the package management process. Two of the package managers you can use in NodeJS projects are \"yarn\" and \"npm\". While you can use both, we encourage you to use only one of them while working on projects. Using both may lead to different dependencies between members of the team. We’ll start by installing npm following this small guide here. As stated on the web, npm comes inside of NodeJS, and must be updated after installing NodeJS, in the same guide you used earlier are written the instructions to update npm. How npm works In order to explain how npm works, let’s take a command as an example: $ npm install @angular/material @angular/cdk This command tells npm to look for the packages @angular/material and @angular/cdk in the npm registry, download and decompress them in the folder node_modules along with their own dependencies. Additionally, npm will update package.json and create a new file called package-lock.json. After initialization and installing the first package there will be a new folder called node_modules in your project. This folder is where your packages are unzipped and stored, following a tree scheme. Take in consideration both npm and yarn need a package.json in the root of your project in order to work properly. If after creating your project don’t have it, download again the package.json from the repository or you’ll have to start again. Brief overview of commands If we need to create a package.json from scratch, we can use the command init. This command asks the user for basic information about the project and creates a brand new package.json. $ npm init Install (or i) installs all modules listed as dependencies in package.json locally. You can also specify a package, and install that package. Install can also be used with the parameter -g, which tells npm to install the Global package. $ npm install $ npm i $ npm install Package Earlier versions of npm did not add dependencies to package.json unless it was used with the flag --save, so npm install package would be npm install --save package, you have one example below. $ npm install --save Package Npm needs flags in order to know what kind of dependency you want in your project, in npm you need to put the flag -D or --save-dev to install devDependencies, for more information consult the links at the end of this section. $ npm install -D package $ npm install --save-dev package ​ The next command uninstalls the module you specified in the command. $ npm uninstall Package ls command shows us the dependencies like a nested tree, useful if you have few packages, not so useful when you need a lot of packages. $ npm ls npm@@VERSION@ /path/to/npm └─┬ init-package-json@0.0.4 └── promzard@0.1.5 example tree We recommend you to learn more about npm commands in the following link, navigating to the section CLI commands. About Package-lock.json Package-lock.json describes the dependency tree resulting of using package.json and npm. Whenever you update, add or remove a package, package-lock.json is deleted and redone with the new dependencies. \"@angular/animations\": { \"version\": \"4.4.6\", \"resolved\": \"https://registry.npmjs.org/@angular/animations/-/animations-4.4.6.tgz\", \"integrity\": \"sha1-+mYYmaik44y3xYPHpcl85l1ZKjU=\", \"requires\": { \"tslib\": \"1.8.0\" } This lock file is checked every time the command npm i (or npm install) is used without specifying a package, in the case it exists and it’s valid, npm will install the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical dependency trees. It is not recommended to modify this file yourself. It’s better to leave its management to npm. More information is provided by the npm team at package-lock.json Yarn is an alternative to npm, if you wish to install yarn follow the guide getting started with yarn and download the correct version for your operative system. NodeJS is also needed you can find it here. Working with yarn Yarn is used like npm, with small differences in syntax, for example npm install module is changed to yarn add module. $ yarn add @covalent This command is going to download the required packages, modify package.json, put the package in the folder node_modules and makes a new yarn.lock with the new dependency. However, unlike npm, yarn maintains a cache with packages you download inside. You don’t need to download every file every time you do a general installation. This means installations faster than npm. Similarly to npm, yarn creates and maintains his own lock file, called yarn.lock. Yarn.lock gives enough information about the project for dependency tree to be reproduced. yarn commands Here we have a brief description of yarn’s most used commands: $ yarn add Package $ yarn add --dev Package Adds a package locally to use in your package. Adding the flags --dev or -D will add them to devDependencies instead of the default dependencies, if you need more information check the links at the end of the section. $ yarn init Initializes the development of a package. $ yarn install Installs all the dependencies defined in a package.json file, you can also write \"yarn\" to achieve the same effect. $ yarn remove Package You use it when you wish to remove a package from your project. $ yarn global add Package Installs the Global package. Please, refer to the documentation to learn more about yarn commands and their attributes: yarn commands yarn.lock This file has the same purpose as Package-lock.json, to guide the packet manager, in this case yarn, to install the dependency tree specified in yarn.lock. Yarn.lock and package.json are essential files when collaborating in a project more co-workers and may be a source of errors if programmers do not use the same manager. Yarn.lock follows the same structure as package-lock.json, you can find an example of dependency below: \"@angular/animations@^4.2.4\": version \"4.4.6\" resolved \"https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@angular/animations/-/animations-4.4.6.tgz#fa661899a8a4e38cb7c583c7a5c97ce65d592a35\" dependencies: tslib \"^1.7.1\" As with package-lock.json, it’s strongly not advised to modify this file. Leave its management to yarn You can learn more about yarn.lock here: yarn.lock Global packages are packages installed in your operative system instead of your local project, global packages useful for developer tooling that is not part of any individual project but instead is used for local commands. A good example of global package is @angular/cli, a command line interface for angular used in our projects. You can install a global package in npm with \"npm install -g package\" and \"yarn global add package\" with yarn, you have a npm example below: npm global package npm install –g @angular/cli Global npm Global yarn Dependencies are critical to the success of a package. You must be extra careful about which version packages are using, one package in a different version may break your code. Versioning in npm and yarn, follows a semantic called semver, following the logic MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, like for example, @angular/animations: 4.4.6. Different versions Sometimes, packages are installed with a different version from the one initially installed. This happens because package.json also contains the range of versions we allow yarn or npm to install or update to, example: \"@angular/animations\": \"^4.2.4\" And here the installed one: \"@angular/animations\": { \"version\": \"4.4.6\", \"resolved\": \"https://registry.npmjs.org/@angular/animations/-/animations-4.4.6.tgz\", \"integrity\": \"sha1-+mYYmaik44y3xYPHpcl85l1ZKjU=\", \"requires\": { \"tslib\": \"1.8.0\" } As you can see, the version we initially added is 4.2.4, and the version finally installed after a global installation of all packages, 4.4.6. Installing packages without package-lock.json or yarn.lock using their respective packet managers, will always end with npm or yarn installing the latest version allowed by package.json. \"@angular/animations\": \"^4.2.4\" contains not only the version we added, but also the range we allow npm and yarn to update. Here are some examples: \"@angular/animations\": \"=4.2.4\" The version installed must be greater than or equal to 4.2.4 . \"@angular/animations\": \"=4.2.4\" the version installed must be equal to 4.2.4 . \"@angular/animations\": \"^4.2.4\" The version installed cannot modify the first non zero digit, for example in this case it cannot surpass 5.0.0 or be lower than 4.2.4 . You can learn more about this in Versions If you can’t find package.json, you may have deleted the one you had previously, which means you have to download the package.json from the repository. In the case you are creating a new project you can create a new package.json. More information in the links below. Click on Package.json if you come from that section. Creating new package.json in yarn Creating new package.json in npm Using npm install or yarn without package.json in your projects will result in compilation errors. As we mentioned earlier, Package.json contains essential information about your project. If you have package.json, but you don’t have package-lock.json or yarn.lock the use of command \"npm install\" or \"yarn\" may result in a different dependency tree. If you are trying to import a module and visual code studio is not able to find it, is usually caused by error adding the package to the project, try to add the module again with yarn or npm, and restart Visual Studio Code. Be careful with the semantic versioning inside your package.json of the packages, or you may find a new update on one of your dependencies breaking your code. In the following link there is a solution to a problematic update to one package. A list of common errors of npm can be found in: npm errors Use yarn or npm in your project, reach an agreement with your team in order to choose one, this will avoid undesired situations like forgetting to upload an updated yarn.lock or package-lock.json. Be sure to have the latest version of your project when possible. Pull your project every time it’s updated. Erase your node_modules folder and reinstall all dependencies. This assures you to be working with the same dependencies your team has. AD Center recommends the use of yarn. 1.

When using npm it is important to use a version greater 5.0 as npm 3 has major drawbacks compared to yarn. The following guide assumes that you are using npm >= 5 or yarn. Before you start reading further, please take a look at the docs: yarn getting started npm getting started The following guide will describe best practices for working with yarn / npm. When working with package managers it is very important to understand the concept of semantic versioning. Version example 1.2.3 Version 1. 2. 3 Version name when incrementing Major (2.0.0) Minor (1.3.0) Patch (1.2.4) Has breaking changes yes no no Has features yes yes no Has bug fixes yes yes yes The table gives an overview of the most important parts of semantic versioning. In the header version 1.2.3 is displayed. The first row shows the name and the resulting version when incrementing a part of the version. The next rows show specifics of the resulting version - e.g. a major version can have breaking changes, features and bug fixes. Packages from npm and yarn leverage semantic versioning and instead of selecting a fixed version one can specify a selector. The most common selectors are: ^1.2.3 At least 1.2.3 - 1.2.4 or 1.3.0 can be used, 2.0.0 can not be used ~1.2.3 At lease 1.2.3 - 1.2.4 can be used, 2.0.0 and 1.3.0 can not be used >=1.2.3 At least 1.2.3 - every version greater can also be used This achieves a lower number of duplicates. To give an example: If package A needs version 1.3.0 of package C and package B needs version 1.4.0 of package C one would end up with 4 packages. If package A needs version ^1.3.0 of package C and package B needs version 1.4.0 of package C one would end up with 3 packages. A would use the same version of C as B - 1.4.0. Dependencies are always added using a yarn or npm command. Altering the package.json, package-json.lock or yarn.lock file by hand is not recommended. Always use a yarn or npm command to add a new dependency. Adding the package express with yarn to dependencies. yarn add express Adding the package express with npm to dependencies. npm install express The purpose of files yarn.lock and package-json.lock is to freeze versions for a short time. The following problem is solved: Developer A upgrades the dependency express to fixed version 4.16.3. express has sub-dependency accepts with version selector ~1.3.5 His local node_modules folder receives accepts in version 1.3.5 On his machine everything is working fine Afterward version 1.3.6 of accepts is published - it contains a major bug Developer B now clones the repo and loads the dependencies. He receives version 1.3.6 of accepts and blames developer A for upgrading to a broken version. Both yarn.lock and package-json.lock freeze all the dependencies. For example in yarn lock you will find. yarn.lock example (excerp) accepts@~1.3.5: version \"1.3.5\" resolved \"[...URL to registry]\" dependencies: mime-types \"~2.1.18\" negotiator \"0.6.1\" mime-db@~1.33.0: version \"1.33.0\" resolved \"[...URL to registry]\" mime-types@~2.1.18: version \"2.1.18\" resolved \"[...URL to registry]\" dependencies: mime-db \"~1.33.0\" negotiator@0.6.1: version \"0.6.1\" resolved \"[...URL to registry]\" The described problem is solved by the example yarn.lock file. accepts is frozen at version ~1.3.5 All of its sub-dependencies are also frozen. It needs mime-types at version ~2.1.18 which is frozen at 2.1.18. mime-types needs mime-db at ~1.33.0 which is frozen at 1.33.0 Every developer will receive the same versions of every dependency.

The web technologies used for this purpose are CSS, Sass, HTML5 and Typescript. Ionic is used for developing hybrid applications, which means not having to rely on a specific IDE such as Android Studio or Xcode. Furthermore, development of native apps require learning different languages (Java/Kotlin for Android and Objective-C/Swift for Apple), with Ionic, a developer does not have to code the same functionality for multiple platforms, just use the adequate libraries and components. Although the devonfw distribution comes with and already installed Ionic CLI, here are the steps to install it. The installation of Ionic is easy, just one command has to be written: $ npm install -g @ionic/cli If there was a previous installation of the Ionic CLI, it will need to be uninstalled due to a change in package name. $ npm uninstall -g ionic $ npm install -g @ionic/cli The set up of an ionic application is pretty immediate and can be done in one line: ionic start --type=angular ionic start: Command to create an app. : Name of the application. : Model of the application. --type=angular: With this flag, the app produced will be based on angular. To create an empty project, the following command can be used: ionic start MyApp blank --type=angular The image above shows the directory structure generated. There are more templates available that can be seen with the command ionic start --list The templates surrounded by red line are based on angular and comes with Ionic v5, while the others belong to earlier versions (before v4).

This guide assumes that you already have installed: Node.js npm package manager Angular CLI Ionic 5 CLI Capacitor Also, it is a good idea to read the document about PWA using Angular. Figure 1. Basic ionic PWA. To explain how to build progressive web apps (PWA) using Ionic, a basic application is going to be built. This app will be able to take photos even without network using PWA elements. This step can be completed with one simple command: ionic start , where is the name and a model for the app. In this case, the app is going to be named basic-ion-pwa. The styles (scss) and structures (html) do not have anything specially relevant, just colors and ionic web components. The code can be found in devon4ng samples. After this step, the app will allow users take photos and display them in the main screen. First we have to import three important elements: DomSanitizer: Sanitizes values to be safe to use. SafeResourceUrl: Interface for values that are safe to use as URL. Plugins: Capacitor constant value used to access to the device’s camera and toast dialogs. import { DomSanitizer, SafeResourceUrl } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { Plugins, CameraResultType } from '@capacitor/core'; const { Camera, Toast } = Plugins; The process of taking a picture is enclosed in a takePicture method. takePicture calls the Camera’s getPhoto function which returns an URL or an exception. If a photo is taken then the image displayed in the main page will be changed for the new picture, else, if the app is closed without changing it, a toast message will be displayed. export class HomePage { image: SafeResourceUrl; ... async takePicture() { try { const image = await Camera.getPhoto({ quality: 90, allowEditing: true, resultType: CameraResultType.Uri, }); // Change last picture shown this.image = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(image.webPath); } catch (e) { this.show('Closing camera'); } } async show(message: string) { await Toast.show({ text: message, }); } } When Ionic apps are not running natively, some resources like Camera do not work by default but can be enabled using PWA Elements. To use Capacitor’s PWA elements run npm install @ionic/pwa-elements and modify src/main.ts as shown below. ... // Import for PWA elements import { defineCustomElements } from '@ionic/pwa-elements/loader'; if (environment.production) { enableProdMode(); } platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule) .catch(err => console.log(err)); // Call the element loader after the platform has been bootstrapped defineCustomElements(window); Turning an Ionic 5 app into a PWA is pretty easy, the same module used to turn Angular apps into PWAs has to be added, to do so, run: ng add @angular/pwa. This command also creates an icons folder inside src/assets and contains angular icons for multiple resolutions. If you want use other images, be sure that they have the same resolution, the names can be different but the file manifest.json has to be changed accordingly. manifest.json Default configuration. ngsw-config.json At assetGroups → resources add a URLs field and a pattern to match PWA Elements scripts and other resources (images, styles, …​): \"urls\": [\"https://unpkg.com/@ionic/pwa-elements@1.0.2/dist/**\"] To check if an app is a PWA lets compare its normal behaviour against itself but built for production. Run in the project’s root folder the commands below: ionic build --prod to build the app using production settings. npm install http-server to install an npm module that can serve your built application. Documentation here. A good alternative is also npm install serve. It can be checked here. Go to the www folder running cd www. http-server -o or serve to serve your built app. In order not to install anything not necessary npx can be used directly to serve the app. i.e run npx serve [folder] will automatically download and run this HTTP server without installing it in the project dependencies. Figure 2. Http server running on localhost:8081. In another console instance run ionic serve to open the common app (not built). Figure 3. Ionic server running on localhost:8100. The first difference can be found on Developer tools → application, here it is seen that the PWA application (left) has a service worker and the common one does not. Figure 4. Application service worker comparison. If the \"offline\" box is checked, it will force a disconnection from network. In situations where users do not have connectivity or have a slow, one the PWA can still be accessed and used. Figure 5. Offline application. Finally, plugins like Lighthouse can be used to test whether an application is progressive or not. Figure 6. Lighthouse report.","title":"Ionic Progressive Web App","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"ionic_pwa","url":"/typescript/current/ionic/ionic_pwa.html","titles":[{"text":"Assumptions","hash":"_assumptions","id":1},{"text":"Sample Application","hash":"_sample_application","id":2},{"text":"Step 1: Create a new project","hash":"_step_1_create_a_new_project","id":3},{"text":"Step 2: Structures and styles","hash":"_step_2_structures_and_styles","id":4},{"text":"Step 3: Add functionality","hash":"_step_3_add_functionality","id":5},{"text":"Step 4: PWA Elements","hash":"_step_4_pwa_elements","id":6},{"text":"Step 5: Make it Progressive.","hash":"_step_5_make_it_progressive","id":7},{"text":"Step 6: Configure the app","hash":"_step_6_configure_the_app","id":8},{"text":"Step 7: Check that your app is a PWA","hash":"_step_7_check_that_your_app_is_a_pwa","id":9}]},"70":{"id":70,"text":"This page is written to help developers to go from the source code of an ionic application to an android one, with this in mind, topics such as: environment, commands, modifications,…​ are covered. This document assumes that the reader has already: Source code of an Ionic application and wants to build it on an android device, A working installation of Node.js An Ionic CLI installed and up-to-date. Android Studio and Android SDK. When a native application is being designed, sometimes, functionalities that uses camera, geolocation, push notification, …​ are requested. To resolve these requests, Capacitor can be used. In general terms, Capacitor wraps apps made with Ionic (HTML, SCSS, Typescript) into WebViews that can be displayed in native applications (Android, IOS) and allows the developer to access native functionalities like the ones said before. Installing capacitor is as easy as installing any node module, just a few commands have to be run in a console: cd name-of-ionic-4-app npm install --save @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli Then, it is necessary to initialize capacitor with some information: app id, name of the app and the directory where your app is stored. To fill this information, run: npx cap init Throughout the development process, usually back-end and front-end are on a local computer, so it’s a common practice to have different configuration files for each environment (commonly production and development). Ionic uses an angular.json file to store those configurations and some rules to be applied. If a back-end is hosted on http://localhost:8081, and that direction is used in every environment, the application built for android will not work because computer and device do not have the same localhost. Fortunately, different configurations can be defined. Android Studio uses 10.0.0.2 as alias for 127.0.0.1 (computer’s localhost) so adding http//10.0.0.2:8081 in a new environment file and modifying angular.json accordingly, will make possible connect front-end and back-end. \"build\": { ... \"configurations\": { ... \"android\": { \"fileReplacements\": [ { \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.ts\", \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.android.ts\" } ] }, } } Once configured, it is necessary to build the Ionic app using this new configuration: ionic build --configuration=android The next commands copy the build application on a folder named android and open android studio. npx cap add android npx cap copy npx cap open android Once Android Studio is opened, follow these steps: Click on \"Build\" → Make project. Click on \"Build\" → Make Module 'app' (default name). Click on\" Build\" → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s). Click on run and choose a device. If there are no devices available, a new one can be created: Click on \"Create new device\" Select hardware and click \"Next\". For example: Phone → Nexus 5X. Download a system image. Click on download. Wait until the installation finished and then click \"Finish\". Click \"Next\". Verify configuration (default configuration should be enough) and click \"Next\". Check that the new device is created correctly. To test on a real android device, an easy approach to communicate a smartphone (front-end) and computer (back-end) is to configure a WiFi hotspot and connect the computer to it. A guide about this process can be found at https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/9059108?hl=en Once connected, run ipconfig on a console if you are using windows or ifconfig on a linux machine to get the IP address of your machine’s Wireless LAN adapter WiFi. This obtained IP must be used instead of \"localhost\" or \"10.0.2.2\" at environment.android.ts. After this configuration, follow the build steps in \"From Ionic to Android project\" and the first three steps in \"From Android project to emulated device\". To send the built application to a device, you can connect computer and mobile through USB, but first, it is necessary to unlock developer options. Open \"Settings\" and go to \"System\". Click on \"About\". Click \"Build number\" seven times to unlock developer options. Go to \"System\" again an then to \"Developer options\" Check that the options are \"On\". Check that \"USB debugging\" is activated. After this, do the step four in \"From Android project to emulated device\" and choose the connected smartphone. When you build an APK, a dialog gives two options: locate or analyze. If the first one is chosen, Windows file explorer will be opened showing an APK that can be send using email. Download the APK on your phone and click it to install. If everything goes correctly, the Ionic application will be ready to be tested.","title":"Ionic to Android","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"ionic_to_android","url":"/typescript/current/ionic/ionic_to_android.html","titles":[{"text":"Assumptions","hash":"_assumptions","id":1},{"text":"From Ionic to Android project","hash":"_from_ionic_to_android_project","id":2},{"text":"Modifications","hash":"_modifications","id":3},{"text":"Build","hash":"_build","id":4},{"text":"From Android project to emulated device","hash":"_from_android_project_to_emulated_device","id":5},{"text":"From Android project to real device","hash":"_from_android_project_to_real_device","id":6},{"text":"Send APK to Android through USB","hash":"_send_apk_to_android_through_usb","id":7},{"text":"Send APK to Android through email","hash":"_send_apk_to_android_through_email","id":8},{"text":"Result","hash":"_result","id":9}]},"71":{"id":71,"text":"Coding Conventions Dependency Injection Configuration Module Auth JWT Module Swagger TypeORM Serializer Validation Logger Mailer Module ESLint SonarQube Configuration","title":"Guides","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guide-nestjs-home","url":"/typescript/current/nestjs/guide-nestjs-home.html","titles":[]},"72":{"id":72,"text":"We have listed some links to NestJS libraries and common requested feature components we recommend.

First of all, you need to install Nest CLI Execute the command yarn global add @nestjs/cli. You can also use npm: npm install -g @nestjs/cli And then Devon4node schematics globally with the following command: yarn global add @devon4node/schematics or npm install -g @devon4node/schematics If you get an error trying execute any devon4node schematic related to collection not found, try to reinstall devon4node/schematics on the project folder or be sure that schematics folder is inside @devon4node in node_modules. yarn add @devon4node/schematics To start creating a devon4node application, execute the command: nest g -c @devon4node/schematics application [application-name] If you do not put a name, the command line will ask you for one. Initialize TypeORM into your current project in a correct way. nest g -c @devon4node/schematics typeorm Then, you will be asked about which DB you want to use. Generate CRUD methods for a entity. Requires TypeORM installed in the project. It will add the @nestjsx/crud module as a project dependency. Then, generates an entity, a CRUD controller and a CRUD service. It also register the entity, controller and service in the module. Execute nest g -c @devon4node/schematics crud and then you will need to write a name for the crud. Add a TypeORM entity to your project. Requires TypeORM installed in the project. Execute nest g -c @devon4node/schematics entity and you will be asked for an entity name. Add the config module to the project. It will add the @devon4node/common module as a project dependency. Then, it will generate the configuration module into your project and add it in the core module. Also, it generates the config files for the most common environments. The command to execute will be nest g -c @devon4node/schematics config-module Add @devon4node/mailer module to project. It will add the @devon4node/mailer module as a project dependency. Also, it will add it to the core module and it will generate some email template examples. Write the command nest g -c @devon4node/schematics mailer Add swagger module to project. It will add the @nestjs/swagger module as a project dependency. Also, it will update the main.ts file in order to expose the endpoint for swagger. The default endpoint is: /v1/api Execute the command nest g -c @devon4node/schematics swagger Add the auth JWT module to the project. It will add to your project the auth-jwt and user module. Also, it will import those modules into the core module. Execute nest g -c @devon4node/schematics auth-jwt Add cors and helmet to your project. It will add helmet package as project dependency and update the main.ts file in order to enable the cors and helmet in your application. Execute nest g -c @devon4node/schematics security Generate database migrations In order to create migration scripts with TypeORM, you need to install ts-node: yarn global add ts-node or npm i -g ts-node Generate the tables creation migration: yarn run typeorm migration:generate -n CreateTables It will connect to the database, read all entities and then it will generate a migration file with all sql queries need to transform the current status of the database to the status defined by the entities. If the database is empty, it will generate all sql queries need to create all tables defined in the entities. You can find a example in the todo example As TypeORM is the tool used for DB. You can check official documentation for more information. See TypeORM CLI documentation. Currently, we do not have templates to generate devon4node code (we have planned to do that in the future).

In order to ensure that you are following the devon4node coding conventions, you can use the following tools: ESLint: ESLint ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. We recommend to use the ESLint VSCode extension (included in the devonfw Platform Extension Pack) in order to be able to see the linting errors while you are developing. Prettier: Prettier is a code formatter. We recommend to use the Prettier VSCode extension (included in the devonfw Platform Extension Pack) and enable the editor.formatOnSave option. devon4node application schematic: this tool will generate code following the devon4node coding conventions. Also, when you generate a new project using the devon4node application schematic, it generates the configuration files for TSLint and Prettier that satisfy the devon4node coding conventions. When you combine all tools, you can be sure that you follow the devon4node coding conventions. Here we will detail some of most important devon4node coding conventions. To be sure that you follows all devon4node coding conventions use the tools described before. All devon4node code files must be indented using spaces. The indentation with must be 2 spaces. In order to improve the readability of your code, you must introduce whitespaces. Example: if(condition){ must be if (condition) { The file name must follow the pattern: (name in kebab case).(kind of component).(extension) The test file name must follow the pattern: (name in kebab case).(kind of component).spec.(extension) Example: auth-jwt.service.ts auth-jwt.service.spec.ts The interface names must be in pascal case, and must start with I. There is some controversy in starting the interface names with an I, but we decided to do it because is most of cases you will have an interface and a class with the same name, so, to differentiate them, we decided to start the interfaces with I. Other devonfw stacks solves it by adding the suffix Impl in the class implementations. Example: interface ICoffee {} The class names must be in pascal case. Example: class Coffee {} All variable names must be in camel case. const coffeeList: Coffe[]; For all variable declarations we must use const or let. var is forbidden. We prefer to use const when possible. All statements must end with a trailing comma. Example: { one: 'one', two: 'two' // bad } { one: 'one', two: 'two', // good } All anonymous functions must be defined with the arrow function notation. In most of cases it’s not a problem, but sometimes, when you do not want to bind this when you define the function, you can use the other function definition. In this special cases you must disable the linter for those sentence. Comments must start with a whitespace. Example: //This is a bad comment // This is OK For string definitions, we must use single quotes. In all if statements you always must use brackets. Example: // Bad if statement if (condition) return true; // Good if statement if (condition) { return true; } In order to ensure that your new code follows the coding conventions, devon4node uses by default husky. Husky is a tool that allows you to configure git hooks easily in your project. When you make a git commit in your devon4node project, it will execute two actions: Prettify the staged files Execute the linter in the staged files If any action fails, you won’t be able to commit your new changes. If you want to skip the git hooks, you can do a commit passing the --no-verify flag.","title":"Coding Conventions","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guides-coding-conventions","url":"/typescript/current/nestjs/guides-coding-conventions.html","titles":[{"text":"Detailed devon4node Coding Conventions","hash":"_detailed_devon4node_coding_conventions","id":1},{"text":"Indentation","hash":"_indentation","id":2},{"text":"White space","hash":"_white_space","id":3},{"text":"Naming conventions","hash":"_naming_conventions","id":4},{"text":"File naming","hash":"_file_naming","id":5},{"text":"Interface naming","hash":"_interface_naming","id":6},{"text":"Class naming","hash":"_class_naming","id":7},{"text":"Variable naming","hash":"_variable_naming","id":8},{"text":"Declarations","hash":"_declarations","id":9},{"text":"Programming practices","hash":"_programming_practices","id":10},{"text":"Trailing comma","hash":"_trailing_comma","id":11},{"text":"Arrow functions","hash":"_arrow_functions","id":12},{"text":"Comments","hash":"_comments","id":13},{"text":"Quotemarks","hash":"_quotemarks","id":14},{"text":"if statements","hash":"_if_statements","id":15},{"text":"Pre-commit hooks","hash":"_pre_commit_hooks","id":16}]},"76":{"id":76,"text":"devon4node provides a way to generate a configuration module inside your application.

To use the configuration service, you only need to inject it as dependency. As configuration module is defined in the core module, it will be available everywhere in your application. Example: export class MyProvider { constructor(public readonly configService: ConfigurationService) {} myMethod() { return this.confiService.isDev; } } By default, when you use the configuration service it will take the properties defined in the default.ts file. If you want to change the configuration file, you only need to set the NODE_ENV environment property with the name of the desired environment. Examples: in windows execute set NODE_ENV=develop before executing the application, in linux execute NODE_ENV=develop before executing the application or NODE_ENV=develop yarn start. Sometimes, you want to keep some configuration property secure, and you do not want to publish it to the repository, or you want to reuse some configuration file but you need to change some properties. For those scenarios, you can override configuration properties by defining a environment variable with the same name. For example, if you want to override the property host, you can do: set host=\"newhost\". It also works with objects. For example, if you want to change the value of secret in the property jwtConfig for this example, you can set a environment variable like this: set jwtConfig=\"{\"secret\": \"newsecret\"}\". As you can see, this environment variable has a JSON value. It will take object and merge the jwtConfig property with the properties defined inside the environment variable. It other properties maintain their value. The behaviour is the same for the nested objects. In order to add a new property to the configuration module, you need to follow some steps: Add the property to IConfig interface in src/app/core/configuration/types.ts file. With this, we can ensure that the ConfigurationService and the environment files has those property at compiling time. Add the new property getter to ConfigurationService. You must use the get method of ConfigurationService to ensure that the property will be loaded from the desired config file. You can also add extra logic if needed. Add the property to all config files inside the src/config folder. Example: We want to add the property devonfwUrl to our ConfigurationService, so: We add the following code in IConfig interface: devonfwUrl: string; Then, we add the getter in the ConfigurationService: get devonfwUrl(): string { return this.get('devonfwUrl')!; } Finally, we add the definition in all config files: devonfwUrl: 'https://devonfw.com',","title":"Configuration Module","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guides-configuration-module","url":"/typescript/current/nestjs/guides-configuration-module.html","titles":[{"text":"Use the configuration service","hash":"_use_the_configuration_service","id":1},{"text":"Choose an environment file","hash":"_choose_an_environment_file","id":2},{"text":"Override configuration properties","hash":"_override_configuration_properties","id":3},{"text":"Add a configuration property","hash":"_add_a_configuration_property","id":4}]},"77":{"id":77,"text":"The dependency injection is a well-known common design pattern applied by frameworks in all languages, like Spring in Java, Angular and others. The intention of this page is not to explain how dependency injection works, but instead how it is addressed by NestJS. NestJS resolve the dependency injection in their modules. When you define a provider in a module, it can be injected in all components of the module. By default, those providers are only available in the module where it is defined. The only way to export a module provider to other modules which import it is adding those provider to the export array. You can also reexport modules. In order to inject a dependency in a NestJS component, you need to declare it in the component constructor. Example: export class CoffeeController { constructor(public readonly conffeeService: CoffeeService) {} } NestJS can resolve all dependencies that are defined in the module as provider, and also the dependencies exported by the modules imported. Example: @Module({ controllers: [CoffeeController], providers: [CoffeeService], }) export class CoffeeModule {} Inject dependencies in the constructor is the is the preferred choice, but, sometimes it is not possible. For example, when you are extending another class and want to keep the constructor definition. In this specific cases we can inject dependencies in the class properties. Example: export class CoffeeController { @Inject(CoffeeService) private readonly conffeeService: CoffeeService; } In the previous image, the Module A can inject dependencies exported by Module B, Module E and Module F. If module B reexport Module C and Module D, they are also accessible by Module A. If there is a conflict with the injection token, it resolves the provider with less distance with the module. For example: if the modules C and F exports a UserService provider, the Module A will resolve the UserService exported by the Module F, because the distance from Module A to Module F is 1, and the distance from Module A to Module C is 2. When you define a module as global, the dependency injection system is the same. The only difference is now all modules as a link to the global module. For example, if we make the Module C as global the dependency graph will be: When you want to change the provider name, you can use a NestJS feature called custom providers. For example, if you want to define a provider called MockUserService with the provider token UserService you can define it like: @Module({ providers: [{ provide: UserService, useValue: MockUserService, }], }) With this, when you inject want to inject UserService as dependency, the MockUserService will be injected. Custom provider token can be also a string: @Module({ providers: [{ provide: 'USER_SERVICE', useValue: MockUserService, }], }) but now, when you want to inject it as dependency you need to use the @Inject decorator. constructor(@Inject('USER_SERVICE') userService: any) {}","title":"Dependency Injection","component":"typescript","version":"1","name":"guides-dependency-injection","url":"/typescript/current/nestjs/guides-dependency-injection.html","titles":[{"text":"Inject dependencies in NestJS","hash":"_inject_dependencies_in_nestjs","id":1},{"text":"Dependency Graph","hash":"_dependency_graph","id":2},{"text":"Custom providers","hash":"_custom_providers","id":3}]},"78":{"id":78,"text":"This guide covers the import of ESLint reports into SonarQube instances in CI environments, as this is the recommended way of using ESLint and SonarQube for devon4node projects.

You can configure the ESLint analysis parameters in the .eslintrc.js file inside the top-level directory of your project. If you created your node project using the devon4node application schematic, this file will already exist. If you want to make further adjustments to it, have a look at the ESLint documentation. The ESLint analysis script lint is already configured in the scripts part of your package.json. Simply add -f json > report.json, so that the output of the analysis is saved in a .json file. Additional information to customization options for the ESLint CLI can be found here. To run the analysis, execute the script with npm run lint inside the base directory of your project. If you haven’t already generated your CICD-related files, follow the tutorial on the devon4node schematic of our CICDGEN project, as you will need a Jenkinsfile configured in your project to proceed. Inside the script for the SonarQube code analysis in your Jenkinsfile, add the parameter -Dsonar.eslint.reportPaths=report.json.

Following this principle we will be able to do easy to maintain applications. For example, in order to expose all CRUD operations for an entity, you only need to create a controller like: @Crud({ model: { type: Employee, }, }) @CrudType(Employee) @Controller('employee/employees') export class EmployeeCrudController { constructor(public service: EmployeeCrudService) {} } You can find this code in the employee example. Only with this code your exposing the full CRUD operations for the employee entity. As you can see, it’s an empty class with some decorators and the EmployeeCrudService injected as dependency. Simple, isn’t it? The EmployeeCrudService is also simple: @Injectable() export class EmployeeCrudService extends TypeOrmCrudService { constructor(@InjectRepository(Employee) repo: Repository) { super(repo); } } Another empty class which extends from TypeOrmCrudService and injects the Employee Repository as dependency. Nothing else. With these examples you can get an idea of how simple it can be to code a devon4node application . NestJS (and devon4node) applications are designed in a modular way. This allows you to isolate some functionality in a module, and then reuse it in every application that you need. This is the same behaviour that Angular has. You can see it in the NestJS modules like TypeORM, Swagger and others. Also, in devon4node we have the Mailer module. In your applications, you only need to import those modules and then you will be able to use the functionality that they implement. Example @Module({ imports: [ AuthModule, ConfigurationModule ], }) export class SomeModule {} devon4node is designed to create secure enterprise applications. But also, it allow you to do it in a fast way. To increase the productivity devon4node, devon4node provide schematics in order to generate some boilerplate code. For example, to create a module you need to create a new file for a module (or copy it) and write the code, then you need to import it in the AppModule. This is a easy example, but you can introduce some errors: forget to import it in the AppModule, introduce errors with the copy/paste and so on. By using the command nest g module --name it will do everything for you. Just a simple command. In this specific case probably you do not see any advantage, but there are other complex cases where you can generate more complex code with nest and devon4node schematics command.

It also provides a template engine using Handlebars. It is a NestJS module that inject into your application a MailerService, which is the responsible to send the emails using the nodemailer library. Execute the following command in a devon4node project: yarn add @devon4node/mailer To configure the mailer module, you only need to import it in your application into another module. Example: @Module({ ... imports: [ MailerModule.forRoot(), ], ... }) Your must pass the configuration using the forRoot or forRootAsync methods. The forRoot method receives an MailerModuleOptions object as parameter. It configures the MailerModule using the input MailerModuleOptions object. The structure of MailerModuleOptions is: { hbsOptions?: { templatesDir: string; extension?: string; partialsDir?: string; helpers?: IHelperFunction[]; compilerOptions?: ICompileOptions; }, mailOptions?: nodemailerSmtpTransportOptions; emailFrom: string; } Here, you need to specify the Handlebars compile options, the nodemailer transport options and the email address which will send the emails. Then, you need to call to forRoot function in the module imports. Example: @Module({ ... imports: [ MailerModule.forRoot({ mailOptions: { host: 'localhost', port: 1025, secure: false, tls: { rejectUnauthorized: false, }, }, emailFrom: 'noreply@capgemini.com', hbsOptions: { templatesDir: join(__dirname, '../..', 'templates/views'), partialsDir: join(__dirname, '../..', 'templates/partials'), helpers: [{ name: 'fullname', func: person => `${person.name} ${person.surname}`,s }], }, }), ... }) The method forRootAsync enables you to get the mailer configuration in a asynchronous way. It is useful when you need to get the configuration using, for example, a service (e.g. ConfigurationService). Example: @Module({ ... imports: [ MailerModule.forRootAsync({ imports: [ConfigurationModule], useFactory: (config: ConfigurationService) => { return config.mailerConfig; }, inject: [ConfigurationService], }), ... }) In this example, we use the ConfigurationService in order to get the MailerModuleOptions (the same as forRoot) In order to use, you only need to inject using the dependency injection the MailerService. Example: @Injectable() export class CatsService { constructor(private readonly mailer: MailerService) {} } Then, you only need to use the methods provided by the MailerService in your service. Take into account that you can inject it in every place that support NestJS dependency injection. The method sendPlainMail receive a string sends a email. The method signatures are: sendPlainMail(emailOptions: SendMailOptions): Promise; sendPlainMail(to: string, subject: string, mail: string): Promise; Examples: this.mailer.sendPlainMail({ to: 'example@example.com', subject: 'This is a subject', html: 'Hello world' }); this.mailer.sendPlainMail('example@example.com', 'This is a subject', 'Hello world'); The method sendTemplateMail sends a email based on a Handlebars template. The templates are registered using the templatesDir option or using the addTemplate method. The template name is the name of the template (without extension) or the first parameter of the method addTemplate. The method signatures are: sendTemplateMail(emailOptions: SendMailOptions, templateName: string, emailData: any, hbsOptions?: RuntimeOptions): Promise; sendTemplateMail(to: string, subject: string, templateName: string, emailData: any, hbsOptions?: RuntimeOptions): Promise; Examples: this.mailer.sendTemplateMail({ to: 'example@example.com', subject: 'This is a subject', html: 'Hello world' }, 'template1', { person: {name: 'Dario', surname: 'Rodriguez'}}); this.mailer.sendTemplateMail('example@example.com', 'This is a subject', 'template1', { person: {name: 'Dario', surname: 'Rodriguez'}}); Adds a new template to the MailerService. Method signature: addTemplate(name: string, template: string, options?: CompileOptions): void; Example: this.mailer.addTemplate('newTemplate', '{{>partial1}}') Register a new partial in Handlebars. Method signature: registerPartial(name: string, partial: Handlebars.Template): void; Example: this.mailer.registerPartial('partial', 'Hello World') Register a new helper in Handlebars. Method signature: registerHelper(name: string, helper: Handlebars.HelperDelegate): void; Example: this.mailer.registerHelper('fullname', person => `${person.name} ${person.surname}`) As mentioned above, this module allow you to use Handlebars as template engine, but it is optional. If you do not need the Handlebars, you just need to keep the hbsOptions undefined. In order to get the templates form the file system, you can specify the template folder, the partials folder and the helpers. At the moment of module initialization, it will read the content of the template folder, and will register every file with the name (without extension) and the content as Handlebars template. It will do the same for the partials. You can specify the extension of template files using the extension parameter. The default value is .handlebars If you want to work with this module but you don’t have a SMTP server, you can use the streamTransport. Example: { mailOptions: { streamTransport: true, newline: 'windows', }, emailFrom: ... hbsOptions: ... } Then, you need to get the sendPlainMail or sendTemplateMail result, and print the email to the standard output (STDOUT).

The ValidationPipe needs to know how to validate the input. For that purpose we use the class-validator package. This package allows you to define the validation of a class by using decorators. For example: export class Coffee { @IsDefined() @IsString() @MaxLength(255) name: string; @IsDefined() @IsString() @MaxLength(25) type: string; @IsDefined() @IsNumber() quantity: number; } As you can see in the previous example, we used some decorators in order to define the validators for every property of the Coffee class. You can find all decorators in the class-validator github repository. Now, when you want to receive a Coffee as input in some endpoint, it will execute the validations before executing the handler function. In order to be able to use the class-validator package, you must use classes instead of interfaces. As you know interfaces disappear at compiling time, and class-validator need to know the metadata of the properties in order to be able to validate. The ValidationPipe only works if you put a specific type in the handler definition.

Let’s see how it works with an example: @Controller('coffee/coffees') export class CoffeeController { constructor(private readonly coffeeService: CoffeeService) {} @Post('search') @HttpCode(200) async searchCoffees(@Body() search: CoffeeSearch): Promise> { try { return await this.coffeeService.searchCoffees(search); } catch (error) { throw new BadRequestException(error.message, error); } } } As you can see in the example, to create a controller you only need to decorate a class with the Controller decorator. This example is handling all request to coffee/coffees. Also, you have defined one handler. This handler is listening to POST request for the route coffee/coffees/search. In addition, this handler is waiting for a CoffeeSearch object and returns an array of Coffee. In order to keep it simple, that’s all that you need in order to define one route. One important thing that can be observed in this example is that there is no business logic. It delegates to the service layer and return the response to the client. At this point, transformations from the value that you receive from the service layer to the desired return type are also allowed.

Finally, if the service layer throws an error, this handler will catch it and return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response. The controller layer is the only one that knows about the answers to the client, therefore it is the only one that knows which error codes should be sent. In order to do not propagate errors in the incoming payload, we need to validate all data in the controller layer. See the validation guide for more information. In the previous example, we catch all errors using the try/catch statement. This is not the usual implementation. In order to catch properly the errors you must use the exception filters.

With this, you will generate the following files: /employee/.prettierrc /employee/nest-cli.json /employee/package.json /employee/README.md /employee/tsconfig.build.json /employee/tsconfig.json /employee/tslint.json /employee/src/main.ts /employee/test/app.e2e-spec.ts /employee/test/jest-e2e.json /employee/src/app/app.controller.spec.ts /employee/src/app/app.controller.ts /employee/src/app/app.module.ts /employee/src/app/app.service.ts /employee/src/app/core/core.module.ts /employee/src/app/shared/logger/winston.logger.ts /employee/src/app/core/configuration/configuration.module.ts /employee/src/app/core/configuration/model/index.ts /employee/src/app/core/configuration/model/types.ts /employee/src/app/core/configuration/services/configuration.service.spec.ts /employee/src/app/core/configuration/services/configuration.service.ts /employee/src/app/core/configuration/services/index.ts /employee/src/config/default.ts /employee/src/config/develop.ts /employee/src/config/production.ts /employee/src/config/test.ts /employee/src/config/uat.ts /employee/docker-compose.yml /employee/ormconfig.json /employee/src/app/shared/model/entities/base-entity.entity.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/auth.module.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/controllers/auth.controller.spec.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/controllers/auth.controller.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/controllers/index.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/decorators/index.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/decorators/roles.decorator.spec.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/decorators/roles.decorator.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/guards/index.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/guards/roles.guard.spec.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/model/index.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/model/roles.enum.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/model/user-request.interface.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/services/auth.service.spec.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/services/auth.service.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/services/index.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/strategies/index.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.spec.ts /employee/src/app/core/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts /employee/src/app/core/user/user.module.ts /employee/src/app/core/user/model/index.ts /employee/src/app/core/user/model/dto/user-payload.dto.ts /employee/src/app/core/user/model/entities/user.entity.ts /employee/src/app/core/user/services/index.ts /employee/src/app/core/user/services/user.service.spec.ts /employee/src/app/core/user/services/user.service.ts /employee/test/auth/auth.service.mock.ts /employee/test/user/user.repository.mock.ts /employee/src/app/employee/employee.module.ts /employee/src/app/employee/model/entities/employee.entity.ts /employee/src/app/employee/model/index.ts /employee/src/app/employee/controllers/employee.crud.controller.ts /employee/src/app/employee/services/employee.crud.service.ts /employee/src/app/employee/services/index.ts /employee/src/app/employee/controllers/index.ts Open the VSCode Execute the commands: yarn install code . Fill in the entity: src/app/employee/model/entities/employee.entity.ts Add the columns @Entity() export class Employee extends BaseEntity { @Column('varchar', { length: 255, nullable: true }) name?: string; @Column('varchar', { length: 255, nullable: true }) surname?: string; @Column('varchar', { length: 255, nullable: true }) email?: string; } Add the validations @Entity() export class Employee extends BaseEntity { @IsDefined({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.CREATE] }) @IsOptional({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.UPDATE] }) @MaxLength(255) @Column('varchar', { length: 255, nullable: true }) name?: string; @IsDefined({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.CREATE] }) @IsOptional({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.UPDATE] }) @MaxLength(255) @Column('varchar', { length: 255, nullable: true }) surname?: string; @IsDefined({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.CREATE] }) @IsOptional({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.UPDATE] }) @MaxLength(255) @IsEmail() @Column('varchar', { length: 255, nullable: true }) email?: string; } Add the transformations In this specific case, we will not transform any property, but you can see an example in the src/app/shared/model/entities/base-entity.entity.ts file. export abstract class BaseEntity { @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('increment') id!: number; @VersionColumn({ default: 1 }) @Exclude({ toPlainOnly: true }) version!: number; @CreateDateColumn() @Exclude({ toPlainOnly: true }) createdAt!: string; @UpdateDateColumn() @Exclude({ toPlainOnly: true }) updatedAt!: string; } Add swagger metadata @Entity() export class Employee extends BaseEntity { @ApiPropertyOptional() @IsDefined({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.CREATE] }) @IsOptional({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.UPDATE] }) @MaxLength(255) @Column('varchar', { length: 255, nullable: true }) name?: string; @ApiPropertyOptional() @IsDefined({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.CREATE] }) @IsOptional({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.UPDATE] }) @MaxLength(255) @Column('varchar', { length: 255, nullable: true }) surname?: string; @ApiPropertyOptional() @IsDefined({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.CREATE] }) @IsOptional({ groups: [CrudValidationGroups.UPDATE] }) @MaxLength(255) @IsEmail() @Column('varchar', { length: 255, nullable: true }) email?: string; } Add swagger metadata to src/app/employee/controllers/employee.crud.controller.ts @ApiTags('employee') Generate database migrations Build the application: yarn build In order to create migration scripts with TypeORM, you need to install ts-node: yarn global add ts-node Generate the tables creation migration: yarn run typeorm migration:generate -n CreateTables The output will be something similar to: export class CreateTables1572480273012 implements MigrationInterface { name = 'CreateTables1572480273012'; public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise { await queryRunner.query( `CREATE TABLE \"user\" (\"id\" integer PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, \"version\" integer NOT NULL DEFAULT (1), \"createdAt\" datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')), \"updatedAt\" datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')), \"username\" varchar(255) NOT NULL, \"password\" varchar(255) NOT NULL, \"role\" integer NOT NULL DEFAULT (0))`, undefined, ); await queryRunner.query( `CREATE TABLE \"employee\" (\"id\" integer PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, \"version\" integer NOT NULL DEFAULT (1), \"createdAt\" datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')), \"updatedAt\" datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')), \"name\" varchar(255), \"surname\" varchar(255), \"email\" varchar(255))`, undefined, ); } public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise { await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE \"employee\"`, undefined); await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE \"user\"`, undefined); } } The number in the name is a timestamp, so may change in your application. Create a migration to insert data:`yarn run typeorm migration:generate -n InsertData` and fill in with the following code: export class InsertData1572480830290 implements MigrationInterface { public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise { await queryRunner.query( `INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE(id, name, surname, email) VALUES(1, 'Santiago', 'Fowler', 'Santiago.Fowler@example.com');`, ); await queryRunner.query( `INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE(id, name, surname, email) VALUES(2, 'Clinton', 'Thornton', 'Clinton.Thornton@example.com');`, ); await queryRunner.query( `INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE(id, name, surname, email) VALUES(3, 'Lisa', 'Rodriquez', 'Lisa.Rodriquez@example.com');`, ); await queryRunner.query( `INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE(id, name, surname, email) VALUES(4, 'Calvin', 'Becker', 'Calvin.Becker@example.com');`, ); await queryRunner.query(`INSERT INTO USER(id, username, password, role) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?);`, [ 1, 'user', await hash('password', await genSalt(12)), roles.USER, ]); await queryRunner.query(`INSERT INTO USER(id, username, password, role) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?);`, [ 2, 'admin', await hash('admin', await genSalt(12)), roles.ADMIN, ]); } public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise { await queryRunner.query(`DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE`); await queryRunner.query(`DELETE FROM USER`); } } Start the application: yarn start:dev Check the swagger endpoint: http://localhost:3000/v1/api Make petitions to the employee CRUD: http://localhost:3000/v1/employee/employees Write the tests As we do not create any method, only add some properties to the entity, all application must be tested by the autogenerated code.

The samples are: Employee Components example Also, we have another realistic example in the My Thai Star repository. This example is the implementation of My Thai Star backend, which is compatible with the frontend made with Angular. To do that, this node implementation exposes the same API as Java backend. Take care with this example, as we need to follow the Java API, some components do not follow the devon4node patterns and code conventions. This example is the backend part of an TO-DO application. It exposes and API where you can create, read, update and delete a TO-DO list. In order to start the application, run the following commands in the todo folder: $ yarn $ yarn build $ yarn start Now, you can access to the application using the url http://localhost:3000/v1/todo/todos. If you want to now all endpoints exposed, you can see the swagger at: http://localhost:3000/v1/api. Also, in this example we show you how to control the access to you application by implementing an authentication mechanism using JWT and rol based strategy. In order to access to the list of todos (http://localhost:3000/v1/todo/todos), first you need to call to POST http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/login and in the body you need to send the user information: { \"username\": \"user\", \"password\": \"password\" } It will return a JWT token for the user user. The rol of this user is USER, so you can only access to the methods GET, POST and DELETE of the endpoint http://localhost:3000/v1/todo/todos. If you login with the user admin/admin, you will be able to access to the methods UPDATE and PATCH. This is an example of employee management application. With the application you can create, read, update and delete employees. In order to start the application, run the following commands in the todo folder: $ yarn $ yarn build $ yarn start Now, you can access to the application using the url http://localhost:8081/v1/employee/employees. If you want to now all endpoints exposed, you can see the swagger at: http://localhost:8081/v1/api. This is a simple example without authentication. With this example you can learn how to work with database migrations. You can find them in the folder /src/migrations. The TypeORM is configured in order to execute the migrations every time that you start this application at ormconfig.json with the following flag: \"migrationsRun\": true You can also execute the migration manually by typing the command devon4node db migration:run, or revert executing devon4node db migration:revert. Take into account that the database that this application is using is an in-memory sqlite, so every time that you stop the application all data is lost. This example allow you to understand better the execution order of the components of a devon4node application (guards, pipes, interceptors, filters, middleware). In order to start the application, run the following commands in the todo folder: $ yarn $ yarn build $ yarn start In order to see the execution order, you can call to http://localhost:3000/v1. It will show you the execution order of all components except the filters. If you want to know the execution order while a filter is applied, call to the endpoint with the following queries: ?hello=error, ?hello=controller, ?hello=global.","title":"devon4node
