Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor mapping java objects to a relational database we use the Java Persistence API (JPA).\nAs JPA implementation we recommend to use Hibernate. For general documentation about JPA and Hibernate follow the links above as we will not replicate the documentation. Here you will only find guidelines and examples how we recommend to use it properly. The following examples show how to map the data of a database to an entity. As we use JPA we abstract from SQL here. However, you will still need a DDL script for your schema and during maintenance also database migrations. Please follow our SQL guide for such artifacts.\n\n\n"}
