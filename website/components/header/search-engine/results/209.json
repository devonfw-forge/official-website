Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nSecurity is todays most important cross-cutting concern of an application and an enterprise IT-landscape. We seriously care about security and give you detailed guides to prevent pitfalls, vulnerabilities, and other disasters. While many mistakes can be avoided by following our guidelines you still have to consider security and think about it in your design and implementation. The security guide will not only automatically prevent you from any harm, but will provide you hints and best practices already used in different software products.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important aspect of security is proper authentication and authorization as described in access-control. In the following we discuss about potential vulnerabilities and protection to prevent them.\n\n\n"}
