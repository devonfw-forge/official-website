Currently this only works in bash (on windows use git bash). Simply type devon and hit [Tab] to get completion.\n\n\nUpdate\n\nTo update your IDE (if instructed by your ide-admin), you only need to run the following command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that windows is using file-locking what can have ugly side-effects.\nTo be safe, you should have your IDE tools shut down before invoking the above update command.\nE.g. if a tool needs to be updated, the old installation folder will be moved to a backup and the new version is installed on top.\nIf there are windows file locks in place this can fail and mess up things.\nYou can still delete the according installation from your software folder and rerun devon ide update if you ran into this error.\n\n\n\nWorking with multiple workspaces\n\nIf you are working on different branches in parallel you typically want to use multiple workspaces.\n\n\n\n\nGo to the workspaces folder in your ${DEVON_IDE_HOME} and create a new folder with the name of your choice (e.g. release2.1).\n\n\nCheck out (git clone …​) the according projects and branch into that workspace folder.\n\n\nOpen a shell in that new workspace folder (cd to it) and according to your IDE run e.g. eclipse, vscode, or intellij to create your workspace and launch the IDE. You can also add the parameter create-script to the IDE commandlet in order to create a launch-script for your IDE.\n\n\n\n\nYou can have multiple instances of eclipse running for each workspace in parallel. To distinguish these instances you will find the workspace name in the title of eclipse.\n\n\n\n\n"}
