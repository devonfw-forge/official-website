To configure this you put a .properties file for each desired project into the projects sub-folder in your settings. Each .properties file describes one \"project\" which you would like to check out and (potentially) import:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nValue\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\npath\ne.g. myproject, will clone into ${WORKSPACE_PATH}/myproject\n(required) Path into which the projects is cloned. This path is relative to the workspace.\n\n\nworking sets\ne.g. ws1,ws2\n(optional) This will create working sets (in eclipse). Each module (eclipse project) of this project will be part of all these working sets. Working sets will be automatically created if necessary.\n\n\nworkspace\nmain\nWorkspace to use for checkout and import. Default is main.\n\n\ngit.url\ne.g. http://github.com/someorg/someproject\n(required) Git URL to use for cloning the project.\n\n\ngit.branch\ne.g. develop\n(optional) Git branch to checkout. Git default branch is default.\n\n\nbuild.path\ne.g. . (default)\n(optional) The directory inside path where to trigger an initial build after clone or pull (if build.cmd is set). For a regular project use . to build top-level project.\n\n\nbuild.cmd\ne.g. mvn -D skip Tests=true -Darchetype.test.skip=true clean install\n(optional) The devonfw command to invoke to build the project after clone or pull. If omitted no build is triggered.\n\n\neclipse\ne.g. import\n(optional) Desired action for eclipse IDE. If you put import here all modules (eclipse projects) in the current project will be imported into eclipse. If you leave this out or put any other value for this parameter, no change in eclipse is done.\n\n\nactive\ntrue\n(optional) If set to false the project is skipped during the setup.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that the .properties file is parsed via shell and not via java. So be careful with \"advanced\" features .properties files normally support.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
