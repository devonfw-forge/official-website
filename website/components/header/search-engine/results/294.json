This class will be created with its pertinent attributes. The following code snippet shows the example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this object is created, a call to the nexus handler will be performed, specifically the Task CreateRepository&lt;T&gt;(T repositoryDto) method. The example is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload new component:\n\nTo create a component\nsimilarly to the previous step, in order to upload a new repository, an instance of the type of component to be uploaded must be created, in this case it will be of type raw. The class to be created will be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce this object is created, a call to the nexus handler will be performed, specifically the Task UploadComponent&lt;T&gt;(T uploadComponent) method. The example is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieve metadata from component\n\nTo retrieve the component metadata, the Task&lt;Component&gt; GetComponent(string repositoryName, string componentName) method of the nexus handler will be used. The example is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload uploaded file\n\nTo download the file, the Task&lt;string&gt; DownloadAsset(string repositoryName, string assetName) method of the nexus handler will be used. The example is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
