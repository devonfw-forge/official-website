So please make sure you have read its documentation to know where everything is placed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a serverless architecture?\n\nA serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. Your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by AWS.\n\n\n\nInstall the AWS template and Visual Studio AWS tools\n\nIn devon4Net you have some AWS templates available, to install them you can run the following command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing that, you will be able to build a project using the devon4net template that includes the components you need to begin building your first AWS serverless WebAPI.\n\n\n\nCreate a project using the template\n\nNow that everything is in place, you may begin by creating your project using the template:\n\n\n\n\nOpen Visual Studio 2022 and select create a new project.\n\n\nLook for the devon4net AWS Template, select it and click next.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 48. Create a new AWS project using devon4net\n\n\n\nChoose a name and project location and create it.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 49. Create a new AWS project using devon4net\n\n\n\n\n\nThese three procedures will result in the creation of the project in which we will develop our serverless WebAPI.\nFor that, we will just use the project 'Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI.AwsServerless' from the template:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 50. Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI.AwsServerless file structure\n\n\n[[devonfw-guide_devon4net.wiki_howto.asciidoc_step-1---configure-it-in-appsettings.{environment}.json]]\n==== Step 1 - Configure it in appsettings.{environment}.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about these parameters you can check the template or the component documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2 - Set up as startup project\n\n\n\nRight click in the Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI.AwsServerless.\n\n\nSelect the \"Set as Startup Project\" option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 51. Setting a project as Startup project\n\n\n\nStep 3 - Run it\n\nRun the project and now you can start to develop your serverless WebAPI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
