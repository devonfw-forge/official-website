To get some recommendations on starter templates, follow the guide on: template recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy creating a Quarkus project from the command-line or with the project builder, you get a different project structure and have to adapt it to the devon4j conventions shown in the next Chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Structure\n\nWe provide a recommendation and guideline for a modern project structure to help organize your project into logically related modules.\nIn order to comply with the requirements of modern cloud development and microservice architectures, follow the guide and apply the modern project structure to your project. You can also find similar modules in our example projects.\n\n\n\n\n"}
