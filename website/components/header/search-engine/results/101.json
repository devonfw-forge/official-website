You can customize and integrate nearly everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwell established:\nWhile JEE application servers including very expensive commercial products turned out to be a dead-end, spring has guided projects through the changing trends of IT throughout decades.\nIt may be the framework with the longest history track and popularity.\nAs a result you can easily find a lot of developers, experts, books, articles, etc. about spring.\n\n\nnon-invasive and not biased:\nSpring became famous for its non-invasive coding based on patterns instead of hard dependencies. It gives you a lot of freedom and avoids tight coupling of your (business) code.\n\n\n\n\n\nCons\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nHey there!
