The files containing the cached data are stored in directory licenseurls (instead of licenses for the content itself).\n\n\nThe file content looks as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nthe guessed URL\n\n\n2\na line of dashes as separator\n\n\n3\nthe audit info (might be multiple lines)\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to manually change this cached information and thus correct it - similar to manually correcting the license text as described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense guessing is a new feature as of Solicitor 1.3.0.\nThe guessing algorithm might be modified in future versions without further notice which might result in different outcomes for the guessed URLs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
