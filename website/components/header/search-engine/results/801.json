This happens outside Solicitor.\n\n\nThe import step reads this data and transforms it into a common technology independent internal format.\n\n\nIn the normalization step the license information is completed and unified.\nInformation not contained in the raw data is added.\nWhere possible the applicable licenses are expressed by SPDX-IDs.\n\n\nMany open source compontents are available via multi licensing models.\nWithin qualification the finally applicable licenses are selected.\n\n\nIn the legal assessment the compliance of applicable licenses will be checked based on generic rules defined in company wide policies and possibly project specific project specific extensions.\nDefining those rules is considered as \"legal advice\" and possibly needs to be done by lawyers which are authorized to do so.\nFor this step Solicitor only provides a framework / tool to support the process here but does not deliver any predefined rules.\n\n\nThe final export step produces documents based on the internal data model. This might be the list of licenses to be forwarded to the customer or a license compliance report. Data might also be fed into other systems.\n\n\nA more technical oriented view of Solicitor is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three major technical components: The reader and writer components are performing import and export of data. The business logic - doing normalization, qualification and legal assessment is done by a rule engine. Rules are mainly defined via decision tables. Solicitor comes with a starting set of rules for normalization and qualification but these rulesets need to be extended within the projects. Rules for legal evaluation need to be completely defined by the user.\n\n\nSolicitor is working without additional persisted data: When being executed it generates the output direcly from the read input data after processing the business rules.\n\n\n"}
