As this headers provide information about either the client or the server, it can be dangerous if this information lands in the wrong hands.\n\n\nAs Owasp explains in great detail, proper HTTP headers can help prevent security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting, Clickjacking, Information disclosure and more.\n\n\nIn devon we take security very seriously, thatâ€™s why we developed a very easy form of customizing HTTP headers. You will be able to do it configuring the headers in the appsettings.{environment}.json file. A middleware will be configured with those options and will modify each HTTP response according to the specified options.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table shows the options that can be configured.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease refer to the links provided to learn more about each header and what can be done with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nHeader\nDescription\n\n\nAccessControlExposeHeader\nAccess-Control-Expose-Headers\nIndicates which headers may be exposed as part of the response by listing their names.\n\n\nStrictTransportSecurityHeader\nStrict-Transport-Security\nAllows a website to tell browsers that it should only communicate with HTTPS instead of using HTTP.\n\n\nXFrameOptionsHeader\nX-Frame-Options\nCan be used to indicate whether a browser should be allowed to render a page in a &lt;frame&gt;, &lt;iframe&gt;, &lt;embed&gt; or &lt;object&gt;, to prevent attacks such as click-jacking.\n\n\nXssProtectionHeader\nX-XSS-Protection\nPrevents the loading of a page when it detects cross-site attacks.\n\n\nXContentTypeOptionsHeader\nX-Content-Type-Options\nIt is a flag used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed or followed.\n\n\nContentSecurityPolicyHeader\nContent-Security-Policy\nAllows the administrators of a website to control the resources that the User-Agent can upload to a page.\n\n\nPermittedCrossDomainPoliciesHeader\nX-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies\nGrants a web client ermission to handle data across domains.\n\n\nReferrerPolicyHeader\nReferrer-Policy\nDetermines which referrer data, among those sent with the Referer header, should be included with the requests made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the response header does not have a value or does not appear in the optons, it will not be added to the response headers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nHTTP headers - MDN Web Docs\n\n\nHTTP Security Response Headers Cheat Sheet - Owasp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
