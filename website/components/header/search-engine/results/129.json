Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nThe application configuration contains all internal settings and wirings of the application (bean wiring, database mappings, etc.) and is maintained by the application developers at development time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more detail of Spring stack, see here\n\n\n\n"}
