Here a Bean will be created that retrieves via URL the name of a Space e.g. my-space (a Space is equivalent to a Database Schema). Of course a Space needs to be firstly created in order to use it (see also the Example). This bean can be used for all database typical operations e.g. create, read, update and delete data (a complete list can be found here). Another possibility to execute those operations is via spring-data (see section below). The spring-data-gigaspaces automatically detects if a GigaSpaces Bean exists.\n\n\n\n"}
