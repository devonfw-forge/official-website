We keep supporting the Angular 1 based devon4ng framework and are planning a migration of this framework to Angular 2 in the near future. For \"Balu\" we’ve have decided to integrate \"vanilla\" Angular 2.\n\n\nWe have migrated the Restaurant Sample application to serve as a, documented and supported, blueprint for Angular 2 applications. Furthermore, we support three \"kickstarter\" projects which help engagement getting started with Angular2 - either using Bootstrap or Google´s Material Design - or, alternatively, Ionic 2 (the mobile framework on top of Angular 2).\n\n\n\n"}
