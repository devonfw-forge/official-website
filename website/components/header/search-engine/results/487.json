Now it is possible to generate the code for SOAP services as well. There are two use cases available in CobiGen:\n\n\n\n\nSOAP without nested data\n\n\nSOAP nested data\n\n\n\n\nThe \"nested data\" use case is when there are 3 or more entities which are interrelated with each other. CobiGen will generate code which will return the nested data. Currently CobiGen services return ETO classes, CobiGen has been enhanced as to return CTO classes (ETO + relationship).\n\n\nApart from the SOAP code generation, the capability to express nested relationships have been added to the existing ReST code generator as well.\n\n\n\n"}
