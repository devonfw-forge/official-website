This can be done easily by adding the logback.xml to the root of the CobiGen_templates configuration folder. The file should contain at least the following contents, whereas you should specify an absolute path to the target log file (at the TODO). If you are using the (cobigen-templates project, you might have the contents already specified but partially commented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
