Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nCross-cutting aspects belong to the implicit component general. It contains technical configurations and very general code that is not business specific. Such code shall not have any dependencies to other components and therefore business related code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
