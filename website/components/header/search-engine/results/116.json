Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nIf you are facing performance issues and want to do a punctual analysis we recommend you to use glowroot. It is ideal in cases where monitoring in your local development environment is suitable. However, it is also possible to use it in your test environment. It is entirely free and open-source. Still it is very powerful and helps to trace down bottlenecks. To get a first impression of the tool take a look at the demo.\n\n\n\n\n\nJEE/WTP\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nHey there!
