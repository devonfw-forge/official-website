Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nFor devonfw we follow these fundamental key principles for all decisions about architecture, design, or choosing standards, libraries, and frameworks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKISS\nKeep it small and simple\n\n\nOpen\nCommitment to open standards and solutions (no required dependencies to commercial or vendor-specific standards or solutions)\n\n\nPatterns\nWe concentrate on providing patterns, best-practices and examples rather than writing framework code.\n\n\nSolid\nWe pick solutions that are established and have been proven to be solid and robust in real-live (business) projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
