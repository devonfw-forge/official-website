This includes access to a support organization. Therefore, at an early stage of your project, prepare for contacting oracle support in case of technical problems. You will need the Oracle support ID of your customer [i.e. the legal entity who pays the licence fee and runs the RDBMS] and your customer must grant you permission to use it in a service request - it is not legal to use a your own support ID in a customer-related project. Your customer pays for that service anyway, so use it in case of a problem!\n\n\nSoftware components like the JDBC driver or the UCP may be available without a registration or fee but they are protected by the Oracle Technology Network (OTN) License Agreement. The most important aspect of this licence agreement is the fact that an IT service provider is not allowed to simply download the Oracle software component, bundle it in a software artefact and deliver it to the customer. Instead, the Oracle software component must be (from a legal point of view) provided by the owner of the Oracle DB licence (i.e. your customer). This can be achieved in two ways: Advise your customer to install the Oracle software component in the application server as a library that can be used by your custom built system. Or, in cases where this is not feasible, e.g. in a OpenShift environment where the IT service provider delivers complete Docker images, you must advise your customer to (legally, i.e. documented in a written form) provide the Oracle software component to you, i.e. you donâ€™t download the software component from the Oracle site but receive it from your customer.\n\n\n\n"}
