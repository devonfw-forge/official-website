My-Thai-Star is used throughout the tutorial series to demonstrate the basic principles, architecture, and good practices of the different devonfw \"stacks\". There is an elaborated exercise where the readers get to write their own application \"JumpTheQueue\".\n\n\nWe hope that the new tutorial offers a better, more efficient way for people to get started with devonfw. Answering especially the question: how to make a devonfw application.\n\n\ndevon4j tutorial: https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html\ndevon4ng tutorial: https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng/wiki\n\n\n\n"}
