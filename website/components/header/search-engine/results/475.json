Docker containers resemble virtual machines but are far more resource efficient. Because of this, Docker and related technologies like Kubernetes are taking the Enterprise and Cloud by storm. We have certified and documented the usage of devonfw on Docker so we can now firmly state that \"devonfw is Docker\" ready. All the more so as the iCSD Production Line is now supporting devonfw as well. The Production Line is a Docker based set of methods and tools that make possible to develop custom software to our customers on time and with the expected quality. By having first-class support for devonfw on the Production Line, iCSD has got an unified, integral solution which covers all the phases involved on the application development cycle from requirements to testing and hand-off to the client.\n\n\n\n"}
