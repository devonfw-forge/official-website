File structure of the conf folder\n\n\n\n\n\nThe command folder contains the commandlets.\nThe devon script is the key command line interface for devonfw-ide.\nThere is also devon.bat that can be used in cmd or PowerShell.\nAs the devon CLI can be used as a global command on your computer from any directory and gets installed centrally, it aims to be stable, minimal, and lightweight.\nThe key logic to set up the environment variables is therefore in a separate script environment-project and its Windows variant environment-project.bat inside this scripts folder.\nThe file functions contains a collection of reusable bash functions.\nThese are sourced and used by the commandlets.\nFinally the devon.properties file contains defaults for the general configuration of devonfw-ide.\n\n\n\n\n"}
