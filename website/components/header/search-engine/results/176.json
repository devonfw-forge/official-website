Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical products for such a log monitoring system are:\n\n\n\n\nELK-Stack\n\n\nGraylog\n\n\nSplunk\n\n\n\n\nIn devonfw we are not biased for any of these products. Therefore, feel free to make your choice according to the requirements of your project.\n\n\nFor Quarkus applications, you can get an insight into the topic by reading the guide about centralized log management.\n\n\n\n"}
