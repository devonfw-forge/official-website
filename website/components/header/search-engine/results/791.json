File structure of the conf folder\n\n\n\n\n\nThe .m2 folder is used for configurations of maven. It contains the local repository folder used as cache for artifacts downloaded and installed by maven (see also maven repositories).\nFurther, there are two configuration files for maven:\n\n\n\n\nsettings.xml initialized from a template from your devonfw-ide devonfw-guide_ide.wiki_conf.asciidoc_settings. You may customize this to your needs (configuring HTTP proxies, credentials, or other user-specific settings). Secrets can be specified as $[«variable.name»] and will be prompted, encrypted and replaced automatically during the setup (unless in batch mode). Please note that this process is skipped in batch mode and also if you use the default settings URL (for simplicity of testing). To make use of this feature simply fork or copy the settings to your own git repo. In case your credentials have changed or you made a typo, you can simply redo this step by first moving your ${DEVON_IDE_HOME}/conf/.m2/settings.xml file to a temporary folder and then calling devon mvn setup.\n\n\nsettings-security.xml is auto-generated for you by devonfw-ide with a random password. This should make it easier for devonfw-ide users to use password encryption and never add passwords in plain text for better security.\n\n\n\n\nFinally,there is a file variables for the user-specific configuration of devonfw-ide.\n\n\n\n\n"}
