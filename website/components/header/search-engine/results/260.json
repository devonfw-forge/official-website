As the example also shows, two-letter acronyms that begin a camel-cased identifier are both lowercase.\n\n\n Use camelCasing for inline variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Do not use simple concatenation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPascal Case (PascalCase)\n\nThe first letter of each concatenated word is capitalized. No other characters are used to separate the words, like hyphens or underscores.\n\n\nThe PascalCasing convention, used for all identifiers except parameter names, capitalizes the first character of each word (including acronyms over two letters in length).\n\n\n Use PascalCasing for all public member, type, and names of namespaces consisting of multiple words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Do not use any capital letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnake Case (snake_case)\n\nEach word is written in lower case and separated by an underscore. Capital letters and other separation methods arenâ€™t used.\n\n\nThe snake_casing is used in resources file names, database names and keys.\n\n\n Use snake_casing in file names:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Do not use any other symbol than ( _ , - , . ):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderscore Prefix (_underscorePrefix)\n\nIn this type of naming, an underscore is added at the beginning of the word. After it, the name can follow other type of casing, such as camel case\n\n\n Use _underscorePrefix in private fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Do not use underscores in public fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
