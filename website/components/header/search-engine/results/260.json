One of them is using Eclipse which it can be done by using the its graphical interface. The other way to generate the code is using the Cobigen CLI tool.\n\n\nGenerating files through Eclipse\n\nIn order to generate the files using Eclipse we need to follow some simple steps.\n\n\nFirst we are going to import our basic devon4net WebAPI Project into Eclipse. to do so open Eclipse with the “eclipse-main.bat” file that can be found in the devon distribution root folder. Once we are inside of Eclipse we go to File &gt; Open projects from file system…​ and, under \"Directory\", search for your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we copy our OpenAPI file into the root folder of the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then we right click on OpenAPI file and then select CobiGen &gt; Generate…​ It will display a window like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select all .NET features choose CRUD devon4net Server otherwise you can select only those that interest you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnes you select all the files that you want to generate, click on the “Finish” button to generate all the source code.\n\n\n\nGenerating files through Cobigen CLI\n\nIn order to generate the files using the Cobigen CLI it is needed to do the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nGo to devonfw distribution folder\n\n\nRun console.bat, this will open a console.\n\n\nGo to the folder you downloaded the devon4net template and your yml file.\n\n\nRun the command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA list of increments will be printed so that you can start the generation. It has to be selected CRUD devon4net Server increment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
