Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to trends such as microservices, we are building smaller apps compared to moduliths.\nFor simplicity, we therefore do not split our app into different modules and keep everything top-level and easy.\n\n\nIn addition to java and resources, we also add helm for helm templates and docker for docker scripts (e.g. Dockerfile) in src/main:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
