Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nSOAP is a common protocol for services that is rather complex and heavy. It allows to build inter-operable and well specified services (see WSDL). SOAP is transport neutral what is not only an advantage. We strongly recommend to use HTTPS transport and ignore additional complex standards like WS-Security and use established HTTP-Standards such as RFC2617 (and RFC5280).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
