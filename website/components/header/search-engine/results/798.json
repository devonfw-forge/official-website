This is the default timeout for method getDriver().waitForPageLoaded()\n\n\ngetDriver().manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(long time, TimeUnit unit)\nthe amount of time to wait for execution of script to finish before throwing an exception\n\n\ngetDriver().manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(long time, TimeUnit unit)\nthe amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. After that time, it throws an exception. This the default timeout for methods such as getDriver().findElementDynamic(By selector) or getDriver().waitForElement(By selector)\n\n\nChanging timeouts can improve test stability but can also make test run time longer.\n\n\n\nHow to: Start a browser in Incognito/Private mode?\n\nIn MrChecker there is a fpossibility of changing browser options during runtime execution.\n\n\nTo run the browser in incognito mode:\n\n\n\n\nIn Eclipse - open Run Configurations window:\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a test which you want to run and switch to arguments tab:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd VM argument:\n\n\n\nfor the incognito mode in chrome:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about browsers' options: https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-testing/wiki/Run-with-different-browser-options\n\n\n\n\n"}
