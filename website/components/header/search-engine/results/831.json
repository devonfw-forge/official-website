See Experimental Scancode Integration.\n\n\nNew decision table structure LicenseAssignmentV2 with additional condition origin.\nOld structure deprecated but still supported.\nMigrate existing project decision tables by renaming LicenseAssignmentProject.xls to  LicenseAssignmentV2Project.xls and introducing a new (empty) column Origin between existing columns OSS Version and Declared License.\n\n\nAdded Solicitor Logo and code for creating variants / animation.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/devonfw/solicitor/issues/117: New attribute packageUrl in ApplicationComponent.\n\n\nExperimental scancode-toolkit integration changed to using Bash scripting.\n\n\nRuleset change: For GPL/LGPL-Licenses use …​-only   or …​-or-later IDs instead\nof the deprecated ones like GPL-3.0.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/devonfw/solicitor/issues/113:\nAllow project specific writers (additionalWriters) to be defined without overriding default writers.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/devonfw/solicitor/issues/15:\nEnable Decision Tables to be alternatively defined as CSV.\nAllow dynamic determination of applicable format by specifying resource names without file extension.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/devonfw/solicitor/issues/108:\nUpdated spring boot framework, drools rule engine and other used components to latest versions.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/devonfw/solicitor/issues/110:\nAllow an additional user guide to be extracted when using an extension.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in 1.3.0\n\n\n\n\nNew report ScancodeDownloadScript.vm to compile copyright information using ScanCode.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/devonfw/solicitor/issues/75:\nAdded license URL guessing, see Guessing of license URLs.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/devonfw/solicitor/issues/86:\nIn case that downloading content for a given URL fails no WARN message with stacktrace will be shown any more.\nInstead there will be an info message (SOLI-047 or SOLI-048) indicating that the content could not be downloaded.\nThis change is due to the fact that failed downloads are expected - especially with the new feature license URL guessing.\n\n\nReaders for PIP and YARN added.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/devonfw/solicitor/issues/101:\nIf downloaded license texts contain large amounts of html formatted content they will be replaced by a placeholder indicating the need\nfor cleanup.
