However, there are some minimal prerequisites:\n\n\n\n\nYou need to have a tool to extract *.tar.gz files (tar and gzip). On Windows before Version 10 (1803) use 7-zip. On all other platforms this comes out of the box.\n\n\nYou need to have git and curl installed.\n\n\n\nOn Windows you only need to  download and install git for windows. This also ships with bash and curl.\n\n\nOn Linux you might need to install the above tools in case they are not present (e.g. sudo apt-get install git curl or sudo yum install git-core curl)\n\n\nOn MacOS you only need to download and install git for mac.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
