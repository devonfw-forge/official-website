Besides containing\nnaming and version info on the extension this file might override any\nproperty values defined within Solicitor.\n\n\nAny other resources (like rule data or templates) which need to be part of the Extension\ncan be included in the archive as well - either in the root directory or any subdirectories.\nIf the extension is active those resources will be available on the classpath like any\nresources included in the Solicitor jar.\n\n\nOverriding / redefining the default base configuration within the Extension enables to\nupdate all rule data and templates without the need to touch the projects configuration\nfile.\n\n\n\n"}
