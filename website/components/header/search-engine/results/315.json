Is a document store inspired by MongoDB database. It stores data in documents, which are JSON objects containing key-value pairs. It uses BSON which is a Binary representation of JSON with additional type information.\n\n\nOne of the advantages of using this type of NoSQL database is that it allows the use of asynchronous programming techniques following ACID properties on its transactions. This properties are: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability, and they ensure the highest possible data reliability and integrity. This means that you will be able to use async/await on your operations.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe component configuration can be done in appsettings.{environment}.json with the following section:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnableLiteDb: Boolean to activate the use of LiteDb.\n\n\nDatabaseLocation: Relative path of the file containing all the documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up in Devon\n\nFor setting it up using the Devon4Net WebApi template just configure it in the appsettings.{environment}.json.\n\n\nThen you will need to inject the repositories. For that go to Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI.Implementation.Configuration.DevonConfiguration and add the folowing lines in SetupDependencyInjection method:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can use the IRepository&lt;T&gt; by injecting it wherever you want to use it. T will be the entity you will be working with in the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up in other projects\n\nFor setting it up in other projects install it running the following command in the Package Manager Console, or using the Package Manager in Visual Studio:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow set the configuration in the appsettings.{enviroment}.json:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember to set EnableLiteDb to true.\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to your Program.cs file and add the following line to configure the component:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need also to add the repositories you will be using to your services, either by injecting the generic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr by choosing to inject them one by one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you will be able to use the repositories in your class using dependency injection, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
