That is: how can you guarantee that different parties in the client, different providers, all in different locations and time zones during a particular period of time actually understand the requirements of the client, the proposed solution space and the state of implementation.\n\n\nWe offer the Accelerated Solution Design as a possible answer to these challenges. The ASD is carefully designed to be a practical guideline that fosters and ensures the collaboration and communication among all team members.\n\n\nThe Accelerated Solution Design is:\n\n\n\n\nA practical guideline rather than a “methodology”\n\n\nBased on industry standards rather than proprietary methods\n\n\nConsisting of an evolving, “living”, document set rather than a static, fixed document\n\n\nEncapsulating the business requirements, functional definitions as well as Architecture design\n\n\nBased on the intersection of Lean, Agile, DDD and User Story Mapping\n\n\n\n\nAnd further it is based on the essential belief or paradigm that ASD should be:\n\n\n\n\nFocused on the design (definition) of the “externally observable behavior of a system”\n\n\nPromoting communication and collaboration between team members\n\n\nGuided by prototypes\n\n\n\n\nFor more on the devonfw Methodology / ASD, see:\nhttps://github.com/devonfw/devon-methodology/blob/master/design-guidelines/Accelerated_Solution_Design.adoc\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
