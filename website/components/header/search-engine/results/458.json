It is using about 150 OSS products on the server only and on the client even more. Using a platform like devonfw to develop your own custom solution requires handling contained OSS correctly, i.e acting OSS-compliant.\n\n\nPlease read the Open Source policy of your company first, e.g. the Capgemini OSS Policy which contains a short, comprehensive and well written explanation on relevant OSS-knowledge. Make sure you:\n\n\n\n\nunderstand the copyleft effect and its effect in commercial projects\n\n\nunderstand the 3 license categories: \"permissive\", \"weak copyleft\" and \"strong copyleft\"\n\n\nknow prominent license types as e.g. \"Apache-2.0\" or GPL-3.0\" and what copyleft-category they are in\n\n\nare aware that some OSS offer dual/multi-licenses\n\n\nUnderstand that OSS libraries often come with sub-dependencies of other OSS carrying licenses themselves\n\n\n\n\nTo define sufficient OSS compliance measures, contact your IP officer or legal team as early as possible, especially if you develop software for clients.\n\n\n\n"}
