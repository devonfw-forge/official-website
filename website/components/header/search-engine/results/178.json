Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend to use SLF4J as API for logging, that has become a de facto standard in Java as it has a much better design than java.util.logging offered by the JDK.\nThere are serveral implementations for SLF4J. For Spring applications our recommended implementation is Logback. Quarkus uses JBoss Logging which provides a JBoss Log Manager implementation for SLF4J. For more information on logging in Quarkus, see the Quarkus logging guide.\n\n\n"}
