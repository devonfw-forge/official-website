We now offer integration of Spring Data as an alternative or to be used in conjunction with JPA. Spring Data offers significant advantages over JPA through its query mechanism which allows the developer to specify complex queries in an easy way. Overall working with Spring Data should be quite more productive compared with JPA for the average or junior developer. And extra advantage is that Spring Data also allows - and comes with support for - the usage of NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB etc. THis becomes especially critical in the Cloud where NoSQL databases typically offer better scalability than relational databases.\n\n\n\n"}
