Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nOnly in case you need cross-cutting code that aggregates another component you may introduce the component app.\nIt is allowed to depend on all other components but no other component may depend on it.\nWith the modularity and flexibility of spring you typically do not need this.\nHowever, when you need to have a class that registers all services or component-facades using direct code dependencies, you can introduce this component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
