Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy TypeScript repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new TypeScript page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Application development is a very difficult task since there are a lot of different frameworks, patterns and practices nowadays. For that reason, in devonfw we decided to make use of Nx since it is a full front-end framework that includes almost all the different patterns and features that any SPA may need and provides a well defined architecture to development, build and deploy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
