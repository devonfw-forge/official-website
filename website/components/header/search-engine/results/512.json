Further more, a more modularized approach has been followed in the current release of My Thai star application to decouple client from implementation details. Which provides better encapsulation of code and dependency management for API and implementation classes. This has been achieved with creation of a new “API” module that contain interfaces for REST services and corresponding Request/Response objects. With existing “Core” module being dependent on “API” module.

This is just for demonstration purposes. A full micro service framework is already part of devon4j 2.5.0\n\n\n\n"}
