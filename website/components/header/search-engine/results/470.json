However, both the framework as well as the IDE and tool-set remain fully backward compatible with Java 7. We have added documentation to help configuring aspects of the framework to use Java 7 or to upgrade existing projects to Java 8. See: Compatibility guide for Java7, Java8 and Tomcat7, Tomcat8\n\n\n\n"}
