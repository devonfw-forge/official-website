Using commands, you will be able to generate code the same way as you do with Eclipse. This means that you can use CobiGen on other IDEs like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ. Please take a look into the documentation for more info.\n\n\n\nPerformance improves greatly in the CLI thanks to the lack of GUI.\n\n\nYou will be able to use path globs for selecting multiple input files.\n\n\nWe have implemented a search functionality so that you can easily search for increments or templates.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst steps taken on CobiGen refactoring: With the new refactoring we will be able to decouple CobiGen completely from the target and input language. This will facilitate the creation of parsers and mergers for any language.\n\n\n\nNashornJS has been deprecated: It was used for executing JavaScript code inside JVM. With the refactoring, performance has improved on the TypeScript merger.\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving CobiGen templates:\n\n\n\nRemoved Covalent from Angular templates as it is not compatible with Angular 8.\n\n\nAdded devon4ng-NgRx templates that implement reactive state management. Note: The TypeScript merger is currently being improved in order to accept NgRx. The current templates are set as overridable by default.\n\n\nTest data builder templates now make use of Lambdas and Consumers.\n\n\nCTOs and ETOs increments have been correctly separated.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeScript merger has been improved: Now it is possible to merge comments (like tsdoc) and enums.\n\n\nOpenAPI parsing extended to read enums. Also fixed some bugs when no properties were set or when URLs were too short.\n\n\nJava static and object initializers now get merged.\n\n\nFixed bugs when downloading and adapting templates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
