You have to used ${…​} syntax to make it work on all platforms (never use %…​%, $…​, or $(…​) syntax in devon.properties files).\n\n\n\nexport exported_variable=this value will be exported in bash, in windows CMD the export prefix is ignored\n\n\nvariable_name=\n\nthis will unset the specified variable\n\n\n\nvariable_name=~/some/path/and.file\n\ntilde is resolved to your personal home directory on any OS including windows.\n\n\n\narray_variable=(value1 value2 value3)\n\nThis will only work properly in bash worlds but as no arrays are used in CMD world of devonfw-ide it does not hurt on windows.\n\n\n\nPlease never surround values with quotes (var=\"value\")\n\n\nThis format is similar to Java *.properties but does not support advanced features as unicode literals, multi-lined values, etc.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to know what to configure, have a look at the available variables.\n\n\nPlease only tweak configurations that you need to change and take according responsibility. There is a price to pay for flexibility, which means you have to be careful what you do.\n\n\nFurther, you can configure maven via conf/settings.xml. To configure your IDE such as eclipse or vscode you can tweak the settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
