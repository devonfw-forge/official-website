The key features and changes are:\n\n\n\n\nplatform-agnostic (supports Windows, Mac, and Linux in a single distribution)\n\n\nsmall core (reduced the download package from ~2 gigabyte to ~2 megabyte)\n\n\nfast and easy updates (built in update support)\n\n\nminimum number of scripts (removed tons of end-user scripts making things much simpler)\n\n\nfully automated setup (run setup script and you are ready - even for advanced features that had to be configured manually before)\n\n\nsingle command for everything (entire CLI available via new devon command)\n\n\n\n\nFor all the details you should study the documentation starting from the beginning.\n\n\n\n"}
