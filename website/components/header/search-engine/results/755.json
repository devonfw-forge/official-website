Therefore it is not \"installed\" on your system in a classical way. Instead you just create a folder and extract the downloaded archive to it. You only have to install regularly in advance some specific prerequisites like git. All the other softwares remain locally in your devonfw-ide folder. However, there are the following excuses (what is reverted by devon ide uninstall):\n\n\n\n\nThe devon command is copied to your home directory (~/.devon/devon)\n\n\nThe devon alias is added to your shell config (~/.bashrc and ~/.zshrc, search for alias devon=\"source ~/.devon/devon\").\n\n\nOn Windows the devon.bat command is copied to your home directory (%USERPROFILE%\\scripts\\devon.bat)\n\n\nOn Windows this %USERPROFILE%\\scripts directory is added to the PATH of your user.\n\n\nThe devonfw-ide will download a third party software to your ~/Downloads/devonfw-ide folder to reduce redundant storage. You have to delete this folder manually as we do not want to be responsible for data-loss in case users manually put files here.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
