Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor modern projects, we strongly recommend that your build process generates the final deliverable as an OCI compliant container.\nFurther, to go fully cloud-native, you should build your app as a native image via GraalVM AOT compiler.\nTherefore, we recommed to use quarkus as your main framework.\nIn case you want to go with spring, you may consider using spring-native.\n\n\n\n"}
