Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith trends such as cloud, microservices, lean, and agile, we decided for a more modern project structure that fits better to recent market trends.\nWhen starting new projects with devonfw, and especially in the context of cloud-native development, we strongly recommend this modern approach over the classic structure.\n\n\n"}
