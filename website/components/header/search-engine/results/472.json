It is clear and concise but because of the large scope and wide reach of devonfw, it comes with a hefty 370+ pages. For the impatient - and sometimes images do indeed say more than words - weâ€™ve added videos to the Guide which significantly speed up getting started with the diverse aspects of devonfw.\n\n\nFor more information on videos check out our devonfw Youtube channel\n\n\n\n"}
