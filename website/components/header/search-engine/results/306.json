This components are available in the form of NuGet packages. In the Devon4Net repository this packages are placed in the Infrastructure layer which is a cross-cutting layer that can be referenced from any level on the architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 80. Infrastructure directory\n\n\nComponents are class librarys that collaborate with each other for a purpose. They group the necessary code so that they can work according to the specified configuration. For example, the package Devon4Net.Infrastructure.Swagger has isolated the swagger essential pieces of code and has been developed in such a manner that you just need to write a few lines and specify a couple options to get it working the way you need.\n\n\nComponent structure\n\nAll of the components follow a similar structure which includes the next directories:\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration: Static configuration class (or multiple classes) that contains extension methods used to configure the component.\n\n\nHandlers: Classes that are required to manage complex operations or communications.\n\n\nHelpers: Normally static classes that help in small conversions and operations.\n\n\nConstants: Classes that contain static constants to get rid of hard-coded values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause each component is unique, you may find some more directories or less than those listed above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
