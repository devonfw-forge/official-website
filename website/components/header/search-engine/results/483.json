The Active Directory authentication now is included in the new Winauth-ad module whereas the Single Sign-on implementation is included in a separate module called Winauth-sso.\nAlso some improvements have been added to Winauth-sso module to ease the way in which the module can be injected.\n\n\n\n"}
