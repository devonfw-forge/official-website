Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nIn order to map custom datatypes or other types that do not follow the Java bean conventions, you need to write adapters for JAXB (see XML).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
