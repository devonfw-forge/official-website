This is done in response to intensive market pressure and demands from the MU´s (Public Sector France, Netherlands)\n\n\nMost of the IP (Intellectual Property or proprietary) part of devonfw are now published under the Apache License version 2.0 (with the documentation under the Creative Commons License (Attribution-NoDerivatives)).\n\n\nSo you can now use the devonfw distribution (the \"zip\" file), CobiGen, the devonfw modules and all other components without any worry to expose the client unwittingly to Capgemini IP.\n\n\nNote: there are still some components which are IP and are not published under an OSS license. The class room trainings, the Sencha components and some CobiGen templates. But these are not includes in the distribution nor documentation and are now completely maintained separately.\n\n\n\n"}
