It has a large eco-system of additional standards and tools.\n\n\nIn Java there are many different APIs and frameworks for accessing, producing and processing XML. For the devonfw we recommend to use JAXB for mapping Java objects to XML and vice-versa. Further there is the popular DOM API for reading and writing smaller XML documents directly. When processing large XML documents StAX is the right choice.\n\n\n"}
