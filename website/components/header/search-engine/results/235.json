Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nIn order to map custom datatypes or other types that do not follow the Java bean conventions, you need to define a custom mapping. If you create dedicated objects for the XML mapping you can easily avoid such situations. When this is not suitable use @XmlJavaTypeAdapter and provide an XmlAdapter implementation that handles the mapping.\nFor details see here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
