Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nDependency injection is one of the most important design patterns and is a key principle to a modular and component based architecture.\nThe Java Standard for dependency injection is javax.inject (JSR330) that we use in combination with JSR250.\nAdditionally, for scoping you can use CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) from JSR365.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many frameworks which support this standard including all recent Java EE application servers.\nTherefore in devonfw we rely on these open standards and can propagate patterns and code examples that work independent from the underlying frameworks.\n\n\n"}
