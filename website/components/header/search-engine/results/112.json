This is mainly about accessing data from a persistent data-store. External system could also be accessed from the data-access layer if they match this definition, e.g. a mongo-db via rest services.\n\n\nNote: In the modern project structure, this layer is replaced by the domain layer.\n\n\nDatabase\n\nYou need to make your choice for a database. Options are documented here.\n\n\nThe classical approach is to use a Relational Database Management System (RDMS). In such a case, we strongly recommend to follow our JPA Guide. Some NoSQL databases are supported by spring-data so you can consider the repository guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
