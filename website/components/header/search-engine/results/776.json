Variables with the value - are not set by default but may be set via configuration to override defaults.\nPlease note that we are trying to minimize any potential side-effect from devonfw-ide to the outside world by reducing the number of variables and only exporting those that are required.\n\n\nTable 1. Variables of devonfw-ide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nValue\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nDEVON_IDE_HOME\ne.g. /projects/my-project\nThe top level directory of your devonfw-ide structure.\n\n\nPATH\n$PATH:$DEVON_IDE_HOME/software/java:…​\nYou system path is adjusted by devon command.\n\n\nDEVON_HOME_DIR\n~\nThe platform independent home directory of the current user. In some edge-cases (e.g. in cygwin) this differs from ~ to ensure a central home directory for the user on a single machine in any context or environment.\n\n\nDEVON_IDE_TOOLS\n(java mvn node npm)\nList of tools that should be installed and upgraded by default for your current IDE.\n\n\nDEVON_IDE_CUSTOM_TOOLS\n-\nList of custom tools that should be installed additionally. See software for further details.\n\n\nDEVON_CREATE_START_SCRIPTS\n(eclipse vscode)\nList of IDEs that shall be used by developers in the project and therefore start-scripts are created on setup.\n\n\nDEVON_OLD_PATH\n…​\nA \"backup\" of PATH before it was extended by devon to allow recovering it. Internal variable that should never be set or tweaked.\n\n\nWORKSPACE\nmain\nThe workspace you are currently in. Defaults to main if you are not inside a workspace. Never touch this variable in any variables file.\n\n\nWORKSPACE_PATH\n$DEVON_IDE_HOME/workspaces/$WORKSPACE\nAbsolute path to current workspace. Never touch this variable in any variables file.\n\n\nJAVA_HOME\n$DEVON_IDE_HOME/software/java\nPath to JDK\n\n\nSETTINGS_PATH\n$DEVON_IDE_HOME/settings\nPath to your settings. To keep oasp4j-ide legacy behaviour set this to $DEVON_IDE_HOME/workspaces/main/development/settings.\n\n\nM2_REPO\n$DEVON_IDE_HOME/conf/.m2/repository\nPath to your local maven repository. For projects without high security demands, you may change this to the maven default ~/.m2/repository and share your repository among multiple projects.\n\n\nMAVEN_HOME\n$DEVON_IDE_HOME/software/maven\nPath to Maven\n\n\nMAVEN_OPTS\n-Xmx512m -Duser.home=$DEVON_IDE_HOME/conf\nMaven options\n\n\nDOCKER_EDITION\ne.g. DOCKERDESKTOP\nIf set as DOCKERDESKTOP the command devon docker setup will setup Docker Desktop globally at the users computer. Otherwise the setup of Rancher Desktop will be started.\n\n\nGRAALVM_HOME\n$DEVON_IDE_HOME/software/extra/graalvm\nPath to GraalVM\n\n\nDEVON_SOFTWARE_REPOSITORY\n-\nProject specific or custom software-repository.\n\n\nDEVON_SOFTWARE_PATH\n-\nGlobally shared user-specific local software installation location.\n\n\nECLIPSE_VMARGS\n-Xms128M -Xmx768M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M\nJVM options for Eclipse\n\n\ndeprecated: ECLIPSE_PLUGINS\n-\nArray with \"feature groups\" and \"update site URLs\" to customize required eclipse plugins. Deprecated - see Eclipse plugins.\n\n\n«TOOL»_VERSION\n-\nThe version of the tool «TOOL» to install and use (e.g. ECLIPSE_VERSION or MAVEN_VERSION).\n\n\nEXTRA_JAVA_VERSION\n-\nAn additional (newer) version of java that will be used to run java-based IDEs (e.g. eclipse or intellij).\n\n\n«TOOL»_BUILD_OPTS\ne.g.clean install\nThe arguments provided to the build-tool «TOOL» in order to run a build.\n\n\n«TOOL»_RELEASE_OPTS\ne.g.clean deploy -Dchangelist= -Pdeploy\nThe arguments provided to the build-tool «TOOL» in order to perform a release build.\n\n\nDEVON_IDE_TRACE\n\nIf value is not an empty string, the devonfw-ide scripts will trace each script line executed. For bash two lines output: before and again after expansion. ATTENTION: This is not a regular variable working via devon.properties. Instead manually do export DEVON_IDE_TRACE=true in bash or DEVON_IDE_TRACE=true in windows CMD before running a devon command to get a trace log that you can provide to experts in order to trace down a bug and see what went wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
