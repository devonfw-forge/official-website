Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing separation-of-concerns we divide an application into components using our package-conventions and project structure.\nAs described by the architecture each component is divided into layers as described in the project structure.\nPlease note that a component will only have the required layers.\nSo a component may have any number from one to all layers.\n\n\n"}
