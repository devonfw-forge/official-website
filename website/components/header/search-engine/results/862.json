You can also add the parameter create-script to the IDE commandlet in order to create a launch-script for your IDE.\n\n\n\n\nYou can have multiple instances of eclipse running for each workspace in parallel. To distinguish these instances you will find the workspace name in the title of eclipse.\n\n\n\n\n"}
