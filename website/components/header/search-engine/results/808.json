As part of the report creation step this will generate two scripts:\n\n\n\n\noutput/scancode_PROJECTNAME.sh (for downloading the sources, also calls scancodeScan.sh)\n\n\noutput/scancodeScan.sh (for running ScanCode on the downloaded sources)\n\n\n\n\nScripts will include all ApplicationComponents with exception of those where normalizedLicenseType was set to COMMERCIAL.\n\n\n\nDownload Sources and run Scancode\n\nChange to directory output and execute sh scancode_PROJECTNAME.sh.\nThis will download all sources and process them via ScanCode.\nThis might take several hours to complete.\nResults are stored in subdirectory Source of the directory output and is organized in a tree structure given by the PackageURL of the ApplicationComponents.\n\n\n\nSolicitor 2nd run\n\nExecute Solicitor a second time.\nAfter reading the component/license information from the Readers (but before starting the rule engine)\nSolicitor will try to look up ScanCode information from the directory tree in output/Sources for all processed ApplicationComponents. If information is found for an ApplicationsComponent the following is done:\n\n\n\n\nLicense information (including URL of license text) as obtained from the Readers is replaced by the license info found by ScanCode\n\n\nCopyrights are taken from ScanCode results\n\n\nInfo on NOTICE file is taken from the ScanCode results\n\n\nIf the ScanCode results contain information about a project URL then this is stored as ossHomepage\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nMain target of the additional information obtained from ScanCode is currently the new report Attributions_PROJECTNAME.html which lists\n\n\n\n\nall ApplicationComponents (excluding those which are not OSS licensed)\n\n\nwith all found copyrights\n\n\nand all licenses\n\n\nincluding all different license texts\n\n\nand contents of all found NOTICE files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
