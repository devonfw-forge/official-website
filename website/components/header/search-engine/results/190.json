Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is nothing special to consider when creating the entities. In most cases, you can simply take the code from your Spring application and use it for your Quarkus application. Usually, the entities extend a superclass ApplicationPersistenceEntity containing, for example, the id property. You can also take this class from your Spring application and reuse it.\n\n\n\n"}
