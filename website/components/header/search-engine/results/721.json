K3D will create a cluster with a single node with a default name as \"devonfw-cluster\"\n\n\nATTENTION:\nCurrently this feature is new and therefore experimental.\nIt may change in incompatible ways in the next releases until we reach a stable state.\nWe hope that all is working fine for you.\nHowever, do not expect everything to work out of the box.\nIn case you are facing issues (e.g. network problems with Cisco AnyConnect, etc.) please give us feedback so we can improve.\n\n\nThe arguments (devon kubectl «args») are explained by the following table:\n\n\nTable 19. Usage of devon kubectl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument(s)\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nsetup\nsetup Kubernetes (install and verify) as per above flow.\n\n\n«args»\ncall kubectl with the specified arguments.
