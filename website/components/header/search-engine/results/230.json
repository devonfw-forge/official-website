Invalid data is rejected by the application.\nTherefore validation is required in multiple places of an application. E.g. the GUI will do validation for usability reasons to assist the user, early feedback and to prevent unnecessary server requests.\nOn the server-side validation has to be done for consistency and security.\n\n\nIn general we distinguish these forms of validation:\n\n\n\n\nstateless validation will produce the same result for given input at any time (for the same code/release).\n\n\nstateful validation is dependent on other states and can consider the same input data as valid in once case and as invalid in another.\n\n\n\n\n"}
