Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular format to represent and exchange data especially for modern web-clients. For mapping Java objects to JSON and vice-versa there is no official standard API. We use the established and powerful open-source solution Jackson.\nDue to problems with the wiki of fasterxml you should try this alternative xref:devonfw-guide/devon4j.wiki_ Jackson/AltLink.\n\n\n"}
