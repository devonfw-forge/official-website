Under the consideration of the limitations of GraalVM to be used for native images built by Quarkus and Spring Native, there is a strong recommendation towards Quarkus from devonfw.\nOne essential differentiation has to be made on the decision for native or against native applications - the foreseen performance optimization of the JIT compiler of the JVM, which is not available anymore in a native image deployment.\nFor sure, both component frameworks will also run on a JVM getting advantage again from JIT compilation, but depending on the overall landscape then, it is recommended to stay with the knowledge of the available teams, e.g. continue making use of devon4j based on spring or even if already in that state also here make use of Quarkus on JVM.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
