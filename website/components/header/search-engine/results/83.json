With the introduction of frameworks like micronaut and microprofile, Java processes are getting faster and more lightweight. In a similar context, Spring has introduced\nSpring Native which aims to solve the big memory footprint of Spring and its slow startup time to potentially rival the new framework called Quarkus, by Red Hat. This document briefly discusses both of these two frameworks and their potential suitability with devonfw.\n\n\n"}
