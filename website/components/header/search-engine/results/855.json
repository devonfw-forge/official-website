At the end of this phase the internal data model should clearly represent all components and their assigned licenses in normalized form.\n\n\nThe phase itself consists of two decision tables / rule groups:\n\n\nDecision Table: Explicitely setting Licenses\n\nWith this decision table is is possible to explicitely assign NormalizedLicenses to components. This will be used if the imported RawLicense data is either incomplete or incorrect. Items which have been processed by rules of this group will not be reprocessed by the next rule group.\n\n\nDecision table data: LicenseAssignmentV2*.xls/csv\n\n\n\n\nLHS conditions:\n\n\n\nEngagement.clientName\n\n\nEngagement.engagementName\n\n\nApplication.applicationName\n\n\nApplicationComponent.groupId \n\n\nApplicationCompomnent.artifactId \n\n\nApplicationComponent.version \n\n\nRawLicense.origin  (new with \"V2\" version of rules)\n\n\nRawLicense.declaredLicense \n\n\nRawLicense.url \n\n\n\n\n\nRHS result:\n\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.normalizedLicenseType\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.normalizedLicense\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.normalizedLicenseUrl\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n: On these fields the Extended comparison syntax might be used\n\n\nAll RawLicenses which are in scope of fired rules will be marked so that they do not get reprocessed by the following decision table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the \"V2\" version of rules the additional field/condition origin was introduced.\nThis can be used to fire rules only if the raw license data was obtained from a specific data source.\nIts primary intention is to distinguish between data obtained via normal readers or from Scancode data.\nDecision table data for the new data structure is named LicenseAssignmentV2*.xls/csv.\nThe old decision table structure LicenseAssignment*.xls/csv is deprecated but for compatibility reasons still supported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision Table: Detecting Licenses from Imported Data\n\nWith this decision table the license info from the RawLicense is mapped to the NormalizedLicense. This is based on the name and/or URL of the license as imported via the readers.\n\n\nDecision table data: LicenseNameMapping*.xls/csv\n\n\n\n\nLHS conditions:\n\n\n\nRawLicense.declaredLicense \n\n\nRawLicense.url \n\n\n\n\n\nRHS result:\n\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.normalizedLicenseType\n\n\nNormalizedLicense.normalizedLicense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n: On these fields the Extended comparison syntax might be used\n\n\n\n\n"}
