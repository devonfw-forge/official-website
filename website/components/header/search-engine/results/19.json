Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nMessaging Services provide an asynchronous communication mechanism between applications. Technically this is implemented using Apache Kafka .\n\n\nFor spring, devonfw uses Spring-Kafka as kafka framework.\nFor more details, check the devon4j-kafka.\n\n\nFor quarkus, follow Quarkus - Kafka Reference Guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
