Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe domain layer is responsible for the data-model and mapping it to a database.\nThe most common approach is to use a Relational Database Management System (RDMS). In such a case, we strongly recommend to follow our JPA Guide. Some NoSQL databases are supported by spring-data, so you can consider the repository guide.\n\n\nNote: The domain layer is the replacement for the data-access layer in the modern project structure.\n\n\n\n\n"}
