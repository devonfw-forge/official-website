Hence security considerations are important here.\n\n\nCSRF\n\nA common security threat is CSRF for REST services. Therefore all REST operations that are performing modifications (PUT, POST, DELETE, etc. - all except GET) have to be secured against CSRF attacks. See CSRF how to do this.\n\n\n\nJSON top-level arrays\n\nOWASP earlier suggested to never return JSON arrays at the top-level, to prevent attacks without rationale.\nWe digged deep and found anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.\nTo sum it up the attack is many years old and does not work in any recent or relevant browser.\nHence it is fine to use arrays as top-level result in a JSON REST service (means you can return List&lt;Foo&gt; in a Java JAX-RS service).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
