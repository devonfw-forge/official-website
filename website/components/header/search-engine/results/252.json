Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring-boot is a project and initiaitve within the spring-ecosystem that brought a lot of innovation and simplification into app development on top of spring.\nAs of today we typically use the terms spring and spring-boot rather synonymously as we always use spring together with spring-boot.\n\n\n\n"}
