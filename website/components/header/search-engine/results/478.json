In Balu weâ€™ve extended this support to prepared configuration, extensive documentations and supporting examples for all major \"Enterprise\" DB servers. So it becomes even easier for engagements to start using these standard database options. Currently we provide this extended support for Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL.\nFor more information see: devonfw Database Migration Guide\n\n\n\n"}
