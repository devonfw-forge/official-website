It has the necessary classes to configure the connection with the AWS Cloud.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe component configuration must be done in the file appsettings.{environment}.json as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseSecrets: Boolean to indicate if AWS Secrets Manager is being used.\n\n\nUseParameterStore: Boolean to indicate if AWS Parameter Store is being used.\n\n\nCredentials: Credentials for connecting the app with your AWS profile.\n\n\nCognito: Amazon Cognito identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated) and for users who have been authenticated and received a token. An identity pool is a store of user identity data specific to your account.
