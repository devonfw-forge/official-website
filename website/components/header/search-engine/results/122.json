Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it won’t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our coding-conventions we define a clear packaging and layering.\nHowever, there is always cross-cutting code that does not belong to a specific layer such as generic helpers, general code for configuration or integration, etc.\nTherefore, we define a package segment common that can be used as «layer» for such cross-cutting code.\nCode from any other layer is allowed to access such common code (at least within the same component).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
