You can create the project with Maven on the command line or use the online generator. The advantage of the online generator is that you have a pre-selection of dependencies to use in your project.\nFor starters, letâ€™s select the basic dependencies required to develop a REST service with database connectivity (you can use one of the links in the Quarkus template guide): RESTEasy JAX-RS, RESTEasy Jackson, Hibernate ORM, Spring Data JPA API, JDBC Driver (choose the type of database you need), Flyway (if you have database migration schemas), SmallRye Health (optional for Health Monitoring)\n\n\nThe list does not include all required dependencies. We will add more dependencies to the project later. For now, generate the application with these dependencies.\n\n\nMigration Toolkit from Red Hat\n\nRed Hat provides a migration toolkit (MTA, Migration Toolkit for Applications), that supports migration of a Spring to a Quarkus application. There are several versions of this toolkit (e.g., a web console, a Maven plugin, or an IDE plugin).\nThe MTA analyzes your existing application and generates a report with hints and instructions for migrating from Spring to Quarkus. For example, it gives you an indication of which dependencies are not supported in your project for a Quarkus application and which dependencies you need to swap them with. The analysis is rule-based, and you can also add your own rules that will be checked during analysis.\n\n\n\n\n"}
