Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we describe the classic project structure as initially proposed for Java in devonfw.\nIt is still valid and fully supported.\nHowever, if you want to start a new project, please consider using the modern structure.\n\n\n"}
