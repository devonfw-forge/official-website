Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a first introduction to Quarkus, you can read the Quarkus introduction guide. To get a brief overview of where you can find the important Quarkus related guides, follow the chapter guide to the reader.\nAlso, see the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of a Quarkus application compared to the alternative framework Spring.\nThis comparison will be supported by our performance comparison between Spring and Quarkus, which demonstrates the lower resource consumption and startup time of Quarkus applications.\n\n\n\n"}
