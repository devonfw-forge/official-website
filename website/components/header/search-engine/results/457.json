If you distribute your derived work to your business client or any other legal entity in binary packaged form, the license obligations of contained OSS get into effect. Ignoring these leads to a license infringement which can create high damage.\n\n\nTo carefully handle these obligations you must:\n\n\n\n\nmaintain an OSS inventory (to gain transparency on OSS usage and used licenses)\n\n\ncheck license conformity depending on usage/distribution in a commercial scenario\n\n\ncheck license compatibility between used OSS-licenses\n\n\nfulfill obligations defined by the OSS-licenses\n\n\n\n\nObligations need to be checked per license. Frequent obligations are:\n\n\n\n\ndeliver the license terms of all used versions of the OSS licenses\n\n\nnot to change any copyright statements or warranty exclusions contained in the used OSS components\n\n\ndeliver the source code of the OSS components (e.g. on a data carrier)\n\n\nwhen modifying OSS, track any source code modification (including date and name of the employee/company)\n\n\ndisplay OSS license notice in a user frontend (if any)\n\n\nother obligations depending on individual license\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
