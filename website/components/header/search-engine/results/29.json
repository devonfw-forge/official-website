Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarkus offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n\nfast turn-around cycles for developers\nSave changes in your Java code and immediately test the results without restarting or waiting\n\n\nfaster start-up and less memory footprint\nWhen building your app as native-images via GraalVM, it gets highly optimized. As a result, it starts up lightning fast and consumes much less memory. This is a great advantage for cloud deployment as well as for sustainability. You can find a performance comparison between Spring and Quarkus here.\n\n\nclean and lean\nAs quarkus was born as a cloud-native framework, it is very light-weight and does not carry much history and legacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
