When using the builtin default base configuration all those decision tables use the internal sample data / rules as contained in Solicitor.\n\n\nTo use your own rule data there are three approaches:\n\n\n\n\nInclude your own rules section in the project configuration file (so not inheriting from the builtin base configuration file) and reference your own decision tables there.\n\n\nCreate your own \"Solicitor Extension\" which might completely redefine/replace the buitin Solicitor setup including all decision tables and the base configuration file. See Extending Solicitor for details.\n\n\nMake use of the optional project specific decision tables which are defined in the default base configuration: For every builtin decision table there is an optional external decision table (expected in the filesystem) which will be checked for existence. If such external decision table exists it will be processed first - before processing the builtin decision table. Thus is it possible to amend / override the builtin rules by project specific rules. When you create the starter configuration of your project as described in Starting a new project, those project specific decision tables are automatically created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
