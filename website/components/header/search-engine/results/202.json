Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nREST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an inter-operable protocol for services that is more lightweight than SOAP.\nHowever, it is no real standard and can cause confusion (see REST philosophy).\nTherefore we define best practices here to guide you.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
