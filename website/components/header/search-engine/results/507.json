Based on a radical transformation of on/near/offshore software delivery, the focus of the ADcenters is to deliver agile &amp; accelerated “Rightshore” services with an emphasis on:\n\n\n\n\nDelivering Business Value and optimized User Experience\n\n\nInnovative software development with state of the art technology\n\n\nHighly automated devops; resulting in lower costs &amp; shorter time-to-market\n\n\n\n\nThe first two ADcenters, in Valencia (Spain) and Bangalore (India), are already servicing clients all over Europe - Germany, France, Switzerland  and the Netherlands - while ADcenter aligned production teams are currently working for Capgemini UK as well (through Spain).Through the ADcenter, Capgemini establishes industrialized innovation; designed for &amp; with the user. The availability of platforms for industrialized software delivery like devonfw and the Production Line has allowed us to train and make available over a 150 people in very short time.\n\n\nThe creation of the ADcenter is such a short time is visible proof that we´re getting closer to a situation where devonfw and Production Line are turning into the default development platform for APPS2, thereby standardizing all aspects of the software development life cycle: from training and design, architecture, devops and development,  all the way up to QA and deployment.\n\n\n\n"}
