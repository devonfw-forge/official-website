You can add MicroProfile annotations to further describe your REST endpoints and extend the OpenAPI documentation.\nMore information for this can be found here or here.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nQuarkus recommends using this extension and you can document your APIs in great detail by using the MicroProfile annotations. The downside to this is that using these annotations will blow up your code and you will have some duplicate information in it.\nIf you don’t want to specify the REST API again with all this annotation based information, we also recommend taking a look at the ServicedocGen Maven plugin for your Quarkus applications when implementing JAX-RS APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServicedocGen Maven Plugin\n\nThe ServicedocGen maven plugin can be used within both Spring and Quarkus applications.\nIt works a bit different then the Smallrye extensions mentioned above. The plugin analysis the REST API and it’s JavaDoc and then generate the OpenAPI specification and the Swagger UI as static files. So no Swagger or MicroProfile annotations have to be added.\n\n\nThe plugin can be configured in the pom.xml file of your application as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the configuration section you have to define additional information to generate the OpenAPI specification correctly. An example can be found in our Quarkus reference application.\nWhen building the application, an OpenApi.yaml and a SwaggerUI.html file are created in the /target/site folder. To make the Swagger UI available in the browser, the file must be served by some servlet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
