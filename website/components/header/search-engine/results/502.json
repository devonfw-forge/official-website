Officially my-that-star is still considered to be an incubator as especially this last part is still not as mature as it could be. But the example application and tutorial are 100% complete and functional and form a marked improvement over the \"old\" restaurant example app. My-Thai-star will become the standard example app from devonfw 3.0 onwards.\n\n\nSee:     https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star\n         https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star/wiki\n\n\n\n"}
