They can create files, refactor existing files, or move files from one place to another.\n\n\nWhat distinguishes Schematics from other generators, such as Yeoman or Yarn Create, is that schematics are purely descriptive; no changes are applied to the actual filesystem until everything is ready to be committed. There is no side effect, by design, in Schematics.\n\n\n\n"}
