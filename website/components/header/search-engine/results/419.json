You can build your own docker image from the downloaded RPM using the instructions and dockerfile from oracle. The following commands will build and start Oracle XE 18.4.0 on your machine:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that the buildDockerImage.sh will take a long time. Further after docker run has passed you need to give time for your new container to startup and setup the Oracle XE DB. So be patient and give it some time.\n(In case the build of the docker-image fails reproducibly and you want to give up with the Dockerfiles from Oracle you can also try this inofficial docker-oracle-xe solution. However, this is not recommended and may lead to other problems.).\n\n\nStarting with XE 18c you need to be aware that oracle introduced a multi-tenant architecture. Hence xe refers to the root CDB while you typically want to connect to the PDB (pluggable database) and XE ships with exactly one of this called xepdb1.\nTo connect to your local XE database you need to use xepdb1 as the Service Name (typically in SQL Developer). The hostname should be localhost and the port is by default 1521 if you did not remap it with docker to something else.\nIn order to create schema users, use sys as Username and change Role to SYSDBA.\n\n\nHint: If you happen to end up connected to xe instead of xepdb1 in some case (e.g. in sqlplus), you may switch using this statement:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe JDBC URL for your Oracle XE Database is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo locally connect as sysdba without password use the following command (connect / as sysdba is not working anymore):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
