According to this detection, it will simply delegate to the according commandlet of the specific build system. If that build-system is not yet available it will be downloaded and installed automatically.\n\n\nSo devon build allows users to build any project without bothering about the build-system. Further specific build options can be configured per project. This makes devon build a universal part of every definition of done. Before pushing your changes, please always run the following command to verify the build:\n\n\ndevon build\n\n\nYou may also supply additional arguments as devon build «args». This will simply delegate these arguments to the detected build command (e.g. call mvn «args»).\n\n\n\n\n"}
