In general it will\nbe required to correct, supplement and extend this data sets and templates. This can be done straightforward\nby creating copies of the appropriate resources (rule data XLS/CSV and template files), adopting them and furtheron referencing those copies instead of the original resources from the project configuration file.\n\n\nEven though this approach is possible it will result in hard to maintain configurations,\nespecially in the case of multiple projects using Solicitor in parallel.\n\n\nTo support such scenarios Solicitor provides an easy extension mechanism which allows\nto package all those customized configurations into a single archive and reference it from the\ncommand line when starting Solicitor.\n\n\nThis facilitates configuration management, distribution and deployment of such extensions.\n\n\n"}
