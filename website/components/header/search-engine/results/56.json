Your templates folder must contain the crud_java_ea_uml folder.\nIf you do not see it, please follow the next steps:\n\n\n\n\nDownload the accumulative patch.\n\n\nOpen the zip file and extract its content inside the root folder of your Devonfw distribution Devon-dist_2.4.0/\n\n\n\n\nAfter following those steps correctly, you should have the latest version of the templates ready to use.\n\n\n\nGeneration\n\nIn this tutorial, we are going to generate the entity infrastructure using as input a class diagram, modelled with Enterprise Architect (EA). First, create a class diagram, an example is shown on figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished, you will have to export that UML diagram into an XMI version 2.1 file. This is the file format that CobiGen understands. See below a figure showing this process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo open that window, see this tutorial.\n\n\nAfter having that exported file, change its extension from xmi to xml. Then create an devon4j project and import the exported file into the core of your devon4j project.\n\n\nNow we are going to start the generation, right-click your exported file and select  CobiGen &gt; Generate, finally select the entity infrastructure increment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter following all these steps, your generated files should be inside src\\main\\java folder. If you want an XMI example, you will find it here.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
