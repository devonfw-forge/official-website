Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nIn case you want to manage application performance regularly we recommend to use JavaMelody that can be integrated into your application. More information on javamelody is available on the JavaMelody Wiki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
