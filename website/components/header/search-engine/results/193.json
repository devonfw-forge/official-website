Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the logic layer, devon4j uses a use-case approach. You can reuse the use case interfaces from the api module of the Spring application. Again, make sure to rename the transfer objects.\n\n\nCreate the appropriate class that implements the interface. Follow the implementation section of the use-case guide to implement the methods. For mapping the entities to the corresponding transfer objects, see the next section.\n\n\n\n"}
