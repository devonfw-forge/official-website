Beck) by itself reducing the need for comments and documentation\n\n\nAvoid “repeating the code” and commenting the obvious\n\n\nAvoid commenting “tricky code”: rewrite it! If there’s no time at present to refactor a tricky section, mark it with a TODO comment and schedule time to take care of it as soon as possible. In Visual Studio you can even navigate through the TODOs so you’ll never forget what needs to be done.\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective comments\n\n\n\nUse comments to summarize a section of code\n\n\nUse comments to clarify sensitive pieces of code\n\n\nUse comments to clarify the intent of the code\n\n\nBad written or out-of-date comments are more damaging than helpful:\n\n\nWrite clear and effective comments\n\n\nPay attention to pre-existing comments when modifying code or copying&amp;pasting code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
