To do so it is needed to locate the services and the repositories files that were created in Devon4Net.WebAPI.Implementation\n\n\nServices location:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepositories location:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we are going to open the following file Devon4Net.WebAPI.Implementation\\Configure\\DevonConfiguration.cs.\nIn there we have to add the Dependency Injection for the services and the repositories that Cobigen has generated. The following image is an example of what is needed to add.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover it is needed to remove the last line in order to be able to run the application:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure data base\n\nCobigen is generating an empty context that has to be filled with manually in order to be able to work with the database. The context can be found in [Project_Name]/Devon4Net.WebAPI.Implementation/Domain/Database/CobigenContext.cs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure services\n\nIn order to finish the configuration of the services it is needed to go to each service file of the managements generated.\n\n\nIn there we will see some \"NotImplementedExceptions\", so it is needed to read carefully each comment inside of each exception in order to be able to use the service. It can be shown an example of the service with its NotImplementedExceptions comments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the application\n\nAfter doing all the steps defined above, open a terminal in path: [Project_Name]/Devon4Net.Application.WebAPI and then type:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will deploy our application in our localhost with the port 8081, so when you click here (https://localhost:8082/swagger) you can see, in swagger, all the services and the data model.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
