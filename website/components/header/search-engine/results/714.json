Such instructions will be given below inside the sections for Windows, Mac and Linux.\nATTENTION:\nCurrently this feature is new and therefore experimental.\nIt may change in incompatible ways in the next releases until we reach a stable state.\nWe hope that all is working fine for you.\nHowever, do not expect everything to work out of the box.\nIn case you are facing issues (e.g. network problems with Cisco AnyConnect, etc.) please give us feedback so we can improve.\n\n\nThe arguments (devon docker «args») are explained by the following table:\n\n\nTable 5. Usage of devon docker\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument(s)\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nsetup\nsetup Docker (install and verify) as per above flow.\n\n\n«args»\ncall docker with the specified arguments. Call docker help for details or use docker directly as preferred.\" («args»)\n\n\n\n\nsetup\n\nThe Docker commandlet will install Docker Desktop or Rancher Desktop automatically.\nThis depends on how the variable DOCKER_EDITION was set. We chose to set Rancher Desktop as standard\nfor our installation, due to it being license free compared to Docker Desktop while offering a similar tool set (please read the document docker-desktop-alternative motivating why we added Rancher Desktop to the docker commandlet).\nDocker Desktop can still be used as before, by setting the variable DOCKER_EDITION equal to \"DOCKERDESKTOP\".\nThis can be done by your projects ide-admin in the settings file. If you want to switch from Rancher Desktop to Docker Desktop, then add a line with the following content\n\"DOCKER_EDITION=DOCKERDESKTOP\"\n(without the quotes around the allocation) to the file devon.properties located at the path ${DEVON_IDE_HOME}/conf/devon.properties.\n\n\nAfter successfull installation please start Rancher Desktop and go to the menu point \"Kubernetes Settings\". Under \"Container Runtime\" choose dockerd(moby) to enable the docker-cli. If you use Windows, then make sure to go to the Settings named \"WSL Integration\".\nThere you can choose the WSL Shells you want Rancher Desktop to work on. Besides that the tools like docker or kubectl should\ndirectly work with CMD or Powershell.\n\n\nPlease note that besides the sandbox concept of devonfw-ide this is a global installation on your system.\nWhen uninstalling devonfw-ide, you may have to manually uninstall Docker and Kubernetes, or Rancher Desktop if you do not need it anymore. At least uninstalling Rancher Desktop should leave way less remains if you did not install one of the related software  Rancher Desktop offers separately.\n\n\nrequirements\n\nRunning Docker and especially Kubernetes on your machine in the background will require quite some resources.\nThis will allocate at least 2GB of additional RAM.\n\n\nYou will need at least 8GB of total RAM while we recommend to use 16GB+.\n\n\nYou may also tune and scale it to your needs.\nWhen using Docker Desktop (Windows or MacOS) simply go to the resources tab in the settings.\nIt will depend on your usage frequency if you want to have it running in the background all the time.\nThis is a balance between resource utilization and convenience.\nIf you use Docker and Kubernetes on your local machine on a daily basis this makes sense.\n\n\nIn case you only use Docker rarely, you can save resources by stopping it when not needed after it has been installed.\n\n\n\nWindows and macOS\n\nFor Windows 10 you can use the following Instructions on how to set startup programs for Windows 10, so that Rancher Desktop starts with your OS.\n\n\nTo enable or disable autostart, you can launch Docker Desktop on Windows or MacOS go to the Preferences (gear icon in the title bar). Then in the General tab you can check or uncheck the option Start Docker Desktop when you login (see also here). When autostart is disabled and you launch Docker Desktop it will notice and ask your to start the service or do this automatically for you.\nOn Windows you can also manually tweak this:\n\n\n\n\nHit [windows][r]\n\n\nEnter services.msc\n\n\nConfirm with OK\n\n\nIn the services app search for the Docker Desktop Service in the list and select it.\n\n\nNow you can start or stop the service by clicking on the according link text.\n\n\nAlso when right clicking on Docker Desktop Service and selecting Options from the context-menu, you can change the start type to automatic or manual.\n\n\n\n\nMac A1\n\nHave a look at the Instructions on how to set startup programs for MacOS to make Rancher Desktop run directly after starting up your OS.\n\n\nIn case you have a new Mac with A1 CPU, we automatically download and install the according ARM version of Docker Desktop or Rancher Desktop for macOS.\nHowever, if you use Docker and search for images you may end up with errors like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo with A1 CPU you may need to add --platform linux/x86_64 as option to your Docker command to find the expected container image.\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\nDocker Desktop isn’t available for Linux, but Rancher Desktop can be used as compareable alternative as mentioned before.\n\n\nTo make the usage of Rancher Desktop more comfortable and reliable let your operating system run it after starting up your system.\nOn many Linux distributions you can just go to your menu (usually by clicking the icon at your screens left bottom), type \"startup\" and start your systems GUI-startup manager, if popping up. At the following website you can find some examples or other options on how to set startup programs for some Linux distributions.\n\n\n\n\nusage\n\nOnce installed via setup, you can run Docker from any shell of your OS directly. If you use Rancher Desktop just\nmake sure that Rancher Desktop runs in the background.\nRun docker help to get started and use the online documentations and resources on the web to get familiar with Docker.\nIt is not our intention to repeat this here.\n\n\nPlease note that the docker commandlet is a command wrapper.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
