Tabs in Firefox\n\n\nThis nice feature can be added to many other tools.\n\n\nTabs for Windows Explorer\n\nIf you want to have tabs for windows explorer simply install Clover\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Tabs in Windows Explorer\n\n\n\nTabs for SSH\n\nIf you want to have tabs for your SSH client Putty (or even better Kitty that comes with WinSCP integration) you simply install SuperPutty\nBTW: Windows 10 has already an SSH client included.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Tabs for SSH\n\n\n\nTabs for Shells\n\nIf you want to use different shells like CMD, Powershell, git-bash, WSL, SSH, etc. via tabs inside one window, then use Windows-Terminal that can simply be installed for free via Microsoft Store.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Tabs for multiple shells inside one window\n\n\nFor perfect integration, you should (re-)insall git after Windows-Terminal has been installed and check the option Add a Git Bash Profile to Windows Terminal or follow the manual integration.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Integration of git-bash into Windows-Terminal\n\n\nConEmu\n\nWe recommend to use Windows Terminal now, but for the record here is still the suggestion hint we provided earlier:\n\n\nIf you want to have tabs for your windows command-line you simply install ConEmu. Here you can also add other shells like Putty.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Tabs for CMD\n\n\nSee integration to make ConEmu work flawless with devonfw-ide.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
