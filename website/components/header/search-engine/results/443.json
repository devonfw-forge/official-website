That is not the mistake of the maven-license-tool, but the mistake of the OSS author who didnâ€™t make the respective license-information properly available.\n\n\nDeclare additional licenses in a \"missing file\" within each maven-subproject: /src/license/THIRD-PARTY.properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case the use of \"missing files\" is activated, but the THIRD-PARTY.properties-file is not yet existing, the first run of an \"aggregate-add-third-party\" goal (see below) will fail. Luckily the license-plugin just helped us and created the properties-files automatically (in each maven-subproject) and prefilled it with:\n\n\n\n\na list of all detected licenses within the maven project\n\n\nall OSS libraries where a license could not be detected automatically.\n\n\n\n\nYou now need to fill in missing license information and rerun the plugin.\n\n\n\n"}
