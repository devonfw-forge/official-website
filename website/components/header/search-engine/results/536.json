This version is the first one that fully embraces Open Source, including components like the documentation assets and CobiGen. Most of the IP (Intellectual Property or proprietary) part of devonfw are now published under the Apache License version 2.0 (with the documentation under the Creative Commons License (Attribution-NoDerivatives)). This includes the GitHub repositories where all the code and documentation is located. All of these repositories are now open for public viewing as well.\n\n\n“EVE” contains a slew of new features but in essence it is already driven by what we expect to be the core focus of 2018: strengthening the platform and improving quality.\n\n\nThis release is also fully focused on deepening the platform rather than expanding it. That is to say: we have worked on improving existing features rather than adding new ones and strengthen the qualitative aspects of the software development life cycle, i.e. security, testing, infrastructure (CI, provisioning) etc.\n\n\n“EVE” already is very much an example of this. This release contains the Allure Test Framework (included as an incubator in version 2.3) update called MrChecker Test Framework. MrChecker is an automated testing framework for functional testing of web applications, API web services, Service Virtualization, Security and in coming future native mobile apps, and databases. All modules have tangible examples of how to build resilient integration test cases based on delivered functions.\n\n\nAnother incubator being updated is the devonfw Shop Floor which intended to be a compilation of DevOps experiences from the devonfw perspective. A new part of the release is the new Solution Guide for Application Security based on the state of the art in OWASP based application security.\n\n\nThere is a whole range of new features and improvements which can be seen in that light. devon4j 2.6 changes and improves the package structure of the core Java framework. The My Thai Star sample app has now been upgraded to Angular 6, lots of bugs have been fixed and the devonfw Guide has once again been improved.\n\n\nLast but not least, this release contains the formal publication of the devonfw Methodology or The Accelerated Solution Design - an Industry Standards based solution design and specification (documentation) methodology for Agile (and less-than-agile) projects.\n\n\n\n"}
