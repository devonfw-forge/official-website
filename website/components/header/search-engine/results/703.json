Such commandlet is provided as first argument to the devon command and may take additional arguments:\n\n\ndevon «commandlet» [«arg»]*\n\n\nTechnically, a commandlet is a bash script located in $DEVON_IDE_HOME/scripts/command. So if you want to integrate another tool with devonfw-ide we are awaiting your pull-request.\nEvery commandlet takes the following generic arguments:\n\n\nTable 2.
