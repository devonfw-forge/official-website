Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy TypeScript repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new TypeScript page here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture Overview\n\n\n\n\nThis section introduces in an easy way the main principles and guidelines based on Angular Style Guide.\n\n\n\n\nClient Meta Architecture\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this topic is to support the non-functional requirements for the client, i.e. mostly maintainability, scalability, efficiency and portability. As such it provides a component-oriented architecture following the same principles listed already in the devonfw architecture overview.\n\n\n\n\nComponents Layer\n\n\nServices Layer\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
