Besides the normal reports/documents generated this will also\ncreate scripts for downloading the needed OSS source codes and run Scancode.\n\n\nDownload source codes and run ScanCode by executing the generated scripts. The downloadad sources and ScanCode results will be saved to a directory tree in the local filesytem.\n\n\nExecute Solicitor a second time. For all ApplicationComponents where ScanCode information is available\n(stored in the local directory tree) the license data as obtained from the Readers is replaced by this information. The data model is enriched with the found copyright and notice file information. Reports (see Reporting and Creating output documents) are now based on the ScanCode data (where available).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
