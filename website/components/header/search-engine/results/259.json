Just extracting the zip content is enough to have a fully functional devonfw. The only thing you have to do is run create-or-update-workspace.bat and then update-all-workspaces.bat to set up all the needed tools.\n\n\n\ndevon4net Templates\n\nWe are going to use the template of devon4net as a base to generate all the code, so what we have to do now is to download said template using the following steps.\n\n\nFirst of all you have to set up all the environment for .NET, you can do this using the following tutorial. Next we are going to create a new folder where we want to have the WebAPI project, lastly we are going to open the terminal there.\n\n\nType the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand then:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenAPI File\n\nIn order to let CobiGen generate all the files, we first have to make some modifications to our OpenAPI file.\n\n\nIt is obligatory to put the “x-rootpackage” tag to indicate where CobiGen will place the generated files as well as the \"x-component\" tags for each component, keep in mind that due to `CobiGen’s limitations each component must have its own entity.\n\n\nYou can read more information about how to configure your OpenAPI file and a working example here.\n\n\n\n\n"}
