These are already properly pre-configured in your development environment for auto completion and to view tasks you are responsible for. It is important to keep the number of code tasks low. Therefore, every member of the team should be responsible for the overall code quality. So if you change a piece of code and hit a code task that you can resolve in a reliable way, please do this as part of your change and remove the according tag.\n\n\nTODO\n\nUsed to mark a piece of code that is not yet complete (typically because it can not be completed due to a dependency on something that is not ready).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA TODO tag is added by the author of the code who is also responsible for completing this task.\n\n\n\nFIXME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA FIXME tag is added by the author of the code or someone who found a bug he can not fix right now. The «author» who added the FIXME is also responsible for completing this task. This is very similar to a TODO but with a higher priority. FIXME tags indicate problems that should be resolved before a release is completed while TODO tags might have to stay for a longer time.\n\n\n\nREVIEW\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA REVIEW tag is added by a reviewer during a code review. Here the original author of the code is responsible to resolve the REVIEW tag and the reviewer is assigning this task to him. This is important for feedback and learning and has to be aligned with a review \"process\" where people talk to each other and get into discussion. In smaller or local teams a peer-review is preferable but this does not scale for large or even distributed teams.\n\n\n\n\n"}
