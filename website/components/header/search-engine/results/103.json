Seems like you are still using the documentation of our legacy Java repository. Since it wonâ€™t be maintained anymore, we recommend you to checkout the new Java page here.\nOne essential differentiation has to be made on the decision for native or against native applications - the foreseen performance optimization of the JIT compiler of the JVM, which is not available anymore in a native image deployment.\nDepending on the overall landscape, it is recommended to stay with the knowledge of the available teams, e.g. continue making use of devon4j based on spring or even if already in that state, make use of Quarkus on JVM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
