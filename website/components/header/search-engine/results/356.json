Please read and follow these conventions before making (bigger) changes.\n\n\nUse devon-ide to setup your development environment and get code formatters, etc. configured properly as we do not like \"diff-wars\" because of inconsistent formatter settings.\n\n\nThank you, happy coding!\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
