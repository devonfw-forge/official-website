They enable developers to concisely and efficiently implement portable client-side solutions that leverage existing and well-established client-side HTTP connector implementations. Furthermore, the getting started time for consuming web services has been considerably reduced with the default configuration out-of-the-box which can be tweaked as per individual project requirements.\n\n\nSee: https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/issues/358\n\n\n\nSeparate security logs for devon4j log component\n\nBased on OWASP(Open Web Application Security Project), devon4j aims to give developers more control and flexibility with the logging of security events and tracking of forensic information. Furthermore, it helps classifying the information in log messages and applying masking when necessary. It provides powerful security features while based on set of logging APIs developers are already familiar with over a decade of their experience with Log4J and its successors.\n\n\n\nSupport for Microservices\n\nIntegration of an devon4j application to a Microservices environment can now be leveraged with this release of devon4j. Introduction of service clients for RESTful and SOAP web services based on Java EE give developers agility and ease to access microservices in the Devon framework. It significantly cuts down the efforts on part of developers around boilerplate code and stresses more focus on the business code improving overall efficiency and quality of deliverables.\n\n\n\n\n"}
