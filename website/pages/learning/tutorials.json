On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn node ng npm)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n\nThe installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.\n \n\n\n\n== Clone Repository\nFirst, clone the Jump-The-Queue Repository.\n \n\n==== Prerequisites\n* You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.\n\n==== Download\nOpen a terminal in your current workspace.\n\nFirstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to.\nIf the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal.\nIn this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.\n\nAfter that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.\n\nTo clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/devonfw/jump-the-queue.git` in the terminal.\n\n\n\n== Build and Run Java Server \n=== Build the Java project with Maven\n \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have Maven installed. If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].\n\n==== Execution\n\nNow move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/java/jtqj` in the terminal.\nNext, use the following command to build the java project.\n\n`mvn clean install`\n\nThe maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state.\nInstall will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.\n\n\n\n\n=== Run Java Server\n\n\n\n\n=== Prerequisites\n* Maven (can be included in your devonfw environment)\n\n=== Starting the server\n\nFirst, change the current working directory to where your server is located, i.e. `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/java/jtqj/server`.\n\nAfterwards, use maven to start the server: `mvn spring-boot:run`.\nThis command will start the Java server.\n\n\n\n=== Startup Assertion\n\nYou can check if the server is running correctly by checking if `localhost:8081/jumpthequeue` is accessible by either using a tool like `curl`, `Postman` or simply accessing the service via your webbrowser.\n\nExample: `curl -Is localhost:8081/ | head -n 1`\n\nThis command should return an `200 OK` header if the service is available.\n\n\n\nNow the Java Server should be running.\n\n\n=== Install dependencies\nIn the next steps we want build and run the Angular Frontend Server. For that you need to install the dependencies first.\n \n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* Install Node.js. You can download Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/[here].\n* Installed npm. You can download npm https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm[here] and follow the installation instructions.\n\n==== Execution\n\nYou need to be located in the project directory where the package.json file lies.\nFor this tutorial it is `/home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/angular`. You can either move there manually and open the terminal there or open the terminal and move there by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/angular`.\n\nNow execute `npm install` in the terminal.\n\n\nThis may take some time.\n\n\n\n== Serve the Frontend Server \n=== Changing of the environment.ts file\nNow build and run the Angular Server.\nThe following two steps are only needed in this tutorial. Normally you can simply execute \"ng serve\", open the https://localhost:4200/ and start using the app.\nIn the next step you need to change the Base URL for the REST Services. \n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of environment.ts in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file environment.ts, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to environment.ts and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/jump-the-queue/angular/src/environments` and select the file `environment.ts`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner environment.ts will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, typescript]\n----\nhttps://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8081-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/jumpthequeue/services/rest\n----\n\n\nTo replace the content with a specific placeholder you have to locate the placeholder in the file. The fastest way is to search through the opened file and replace *http://localhost:8081/jumpthequeue/services/rest* with the new content.\n\nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and environment.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n",

Mocking is essentially simulating the behaviour of real data in controlled ways. So in order to use mock data effectively, it is essential to have a good understanding of the software under test and more importantly how it uses its data. As with most things, there are both advantages and disadvantages to doing this.\n\nOne of the big advantages with mock data is that it makes it possible to simulate errors and circumstances that would otherwise be very difficult to create in a real world environment. A disadvantage however is that without good understanding of the software, it will be possible to manipulate data in ways which would never actually happen in the real world.\n\n## Mock Service\n\nServices are often the smoothest files to unit test. A mock service imitates a real REST or SOAP API – it contains definitions for operations that clients call, receives requests, and returns simulated responses.\n\nWhen testing a component with service dependencies, the best practice is mocking them, in order to test the component in an isolated environment. In fact, our purpose is testing the component, not the services, that can be trouble, especially if they try to interact with a server.\n\nHere, we will go through a angular-mock-service sample app.\n\n\n \n\nimage::images/leaderboard.png[]\n\nThe app presents 3 pages as follows:\n\n* A leader board with the top 3 elements\nA leader board can be understood as &#34;the most popular items in a set&#34;, &#34;the latest updated items&#34;, &#34;you favorite items&#34; etc.\n\nimage::images/data-table.png[]\n\n* A data table with all the elements\nA data table with CRUD operations is very useful (in our case we only view details or delete an item, but they illustrate two important things: the details view shows how to navigate and consume a parametric route, the delete action shows how to invoke service operations over the loaded data - this means that the component is reusable and when the data comes with an API, only the service will need it’s implementation changed)\n\nimage::images/detail.png[]\n\n* A details page that reads a route parameter and displays the details of the element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Clone Repository\nFirst, we have to clone the Devon4ng repository to access Angular Mock Service Sample.\n \n\n==== Prerequisites\n* You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.\n\n==== Download\nOpen a terminal in your current workspace.\n\nFirstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to.\nIf the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal.\nIn this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.\n\nAfter that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.\n\nTo clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng.git` in the terminal.\n\n\n\n=== Implementing Mock Data\n\n\n\nLet’s consider a &#39;box of data&#39; represented in JSON. Physically this means a folder with some JSON/TS files in it. They are located in the app/mock folder. The example uses only one mock data file. The file is typed according to our data model.\n\nThe model is represented by the interfaces we make. These interfaces describe the data structures we will use in our application. In this example, there is one data model, corresponding with the &#39;type&#39; of data that was mocked. In the models folder you will find the .ts script file that describes chemical elements. The corresponding mock file defines a set is chemical element objects, in accordance to our interface definition.\n\nimage::images/data-box.jpg[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=== Implementing Mock Service\n\n\n\nA service is an injectable logic that can be consumed by all the components that need it. It can carry manipulation functions and ,in our case, fetch data from a provider.\nInside the Angular App, an Injector gives access to each component to their required services. It’s good coding practice to use a distinct service to each data type you want to manipulate. The type is described in a interface.\n\nHere we simply fetch and display the data of elements and their details.\n\nimage::images/architecture.png[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\nTo conclude, in this tutorial you learned \n\n* the concepts of mock data and services\n\n* the mock architecture with the help of sample app\n\n\n",

On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(ng npm vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n \n\n\n\n== What is mock data and service?\n## Mock Data\nMock data is fake data which is artificially inserted into a piece of software. Mocking is essentially simulating the behaviour of real data in controlled ways.

This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n\nThe installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.\n \n\n\n\n== CobiGen Setup\ndevonfw IDE has been installed for you.\n\n \n\nCobiGen CLI is installed inside your devonfw distribution. In order to execute it follow the next steps:\n\n* Execute the below command to navigate to devonfw installation directory repository.\n\n`cd devonfw`{{execute T1}}\n\n* Execute below command to install CobiGen.\n\n`devon cobigen`{{execute T1}}\n\n* Execute below command to setup devon environment.\n\n`devon`{{execute T1}}\n\nYou have successfully setup CobiGen. \nExecute the below command to verify the installation.\n\n`cobigen -V`{{execute T1}}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn next step, you will learn about CobiGen CLI commands.\n\n\n== CobiGen CLI Commands and Options\nIn this step, you will learn CobiGen commands.\n\n \n\n* Execute the below command to know available CobiGen Commands\n\n`cobigen `{{execute T1}}\n\n* [generate, g]: Command used for code generation.\nTo know more about implementation of this command you can follow https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/cobigen.\n\n* [adapt-templates, a]: Generates a new templates folder next to the Cobigen CLI and stores its location inside a configuration file. After executing this command, the CLI will attempt to use the specified Templates folder.\n\n`cobigen a`{{execute T1}}\n\nTo get more information about rest of all the command visit on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_cobigen-cli.html\n\n\n\n\n\nIn next step, you will learn about how to integrate CobiGen with Eclipse.\n\n\n== Integrate Eclipse with CobiGen\nNote: CobiGen comes preinstalled with devonfw IDE.\n\n1.1  Preconditions\n    - Eclipse 4.x\n\n    - Atleast Java 7 Runtime (for starting eclipse with CobiGen). This is independent from the target version of your developed code\n\n1.2. Installation steps\n    * Open the eclipse installation dialog\n    menu bar → Help → Install new Software\n \n\nimage::images/01-install-new-software.png[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Select Update Site\nHere you can select the updates.\n    2. Open CobiGen’s update site\n\n \n\nimage::images/02-select-update-site.png[]\n\n    Insert the update site of your interest into the filed Work with and press Add\n    Stable releases: https://dl.bintray.com/devonfw/cobigen.p2/\n\n    * Follow the installation wizard\n    Select CobiGen Eclipse Plug-in → Next → Next → accept the license → Finish → OK → Yes\n\n    * Once installed, a new menu entry named &#34;CobiGen&#34; will show up in the Package Explorer’s context menu. In the sub menu there will the Generate​ command, which may ask you to update the templates, and then you can start the generation wizard of CobiGen. \n    \n    * You can adapt the templates by clicking on Adapt Templates which will give you the possibility to import the CobiGen_Templates automatically so that you can modified them.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Checkout (clone) your project’s templates folder or use the current templates released with CobiGen (https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/tree/master/cobigen-templates) and then choose \nImport -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace to import the templates into your workspace.\n\n\n== CobiGen Usage - Simple Mode\n \n\n    Selecting the menu entry Generate​ the generation wizard will be opened.\n    \n    The left side of the wizard shows all available increments, which can be selected to be generated. Increments are a container like concept encompassing multiple files to be generated, which should result in a semantically closed generation output. The type of modification of each file will be encoded into following color scheme if the files are selected for generation:\n\n    - green: files, which are currently non-existent in the file system. These files will be created during generation\n\n    - yellow: files, which are currently existent in the file system and which are configured to be merged with generated contents.\n\n    - red: files, which are currently existent in the file system. These files will be overwritten if manually selected.\n\n    - no color: files, which are currently existent in the file system. Additionally files, which were unselected and thus will be ignored during generation.\n\nimage::images/03-simple-mode-usage.png[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== CobiGen Usage - Batch Mode\n \n\nIf there are multiple input elements selected, e.g., Java files, CobiGen will be started in batch mode. The generation preview will be constrained to the first selected input element. It does not preview the generation for each element of the selection or of a complex input. The selection of the files to be generated will be generated for each input element analogously afterwards.\n\nThus the color encoding differs also a little bit:\n\n    - yellow: files, which are configured to be merged.\n\n    - red: files, which are not configured with any merge strategy and thus will be created if the file does not exist or overwritten if the file already exists\n\n    - no color: files, which will be ignored during generation\n\nimage::images/04-batch-mode-usage.png[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==  \n \n\n## Health Check\nHowever, you might face some errors while using CobiGen. So, we recommend to perform a Health Check for CobiGen Templates for better experience.\n\nTo get more information on Health Check for CobiGen Templates visit on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_eclipse-integration.html#cobigen-eclipse_usage.asciidoc_health-check\n\n## Troubleshooting CLI\nWhen generating code from a Java file, CobiGen makes use of Java reflection for generating templates. In order to do that, the CLI needs to find the compiled source code of your project.\n\nIf you find an error like Compiled class foo\\bar\\EmployeeEntity.java has not been found, it means you need to run &#34;mvn clean install&#34; on the input project so that a new target folder gets created with the needed compiled sources.\n\n## Conclusion\nFrom this tutorial you have learned the following:\n* You can do CobiGen set up in your system.\n* You can use the CobiGen CLI commands to generate the code.\n* You can now integrate CobiGen with Eclipse and generate your crud services.\n* Now you know how to use CobiGen in a particular project with Eclipse as well as CLI.\n\nMore information about CobiGen on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n\nThe installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.\n \n\n\n\n== CobiGen Setup\ndevonfw IDE has been installed for you.\n\n \n\nCobiGen CLI is installed inside your devonfw distribution. In order to execute it follow the next steps:\n\n* Execute the below command to navigate to devonfw installation directory repository.\n\n`cd devonfw`{{execute T1}}\n\n* Execute below command to install CobiGen.\n\n`devon cobigen`{{execute T1}}\n\n* Execute below command to setup devon environment.\n\n`devon`{{execute T1}}\n\nYou have successfully setup CobiGen. \nExecute the below command to verify the installation.\n\n`cobigen -V`{{execute T1}}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn next step, you will learn about CobiGen CLI commands.\n\n\n== CobiGen CLI Commands and Options\nIn this step, you will learn CobiGen commands.\n\n \n\n* Execute the below command to know available CobiGen Commands\n\n`cobigen `{{execute T1}}\n\n* [generate, g]: Command used for code generation.\nTo know more about implementation of this command you can follow https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/cobigen.\n\n* [adapt-templates, a]: Generates a new templates folder next to the Cobigen CLI and stores its location inside a configuration file. After executing this command, the CLI will attempt to use the specified Templates folder.\n\n`cobigen a`{{execute T1}}\n\nTo get more information about rest of all the command visit on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_cobigen-cli.html\n\n\n\n\n\nIn next step, you will learn about how to integrate CobiGen with Eclipse.\n\n\n== Integrate Eclipse with CobiGen\nNote: CobiGen comes preinstalled with devonfw IDE.\n\n1.1  Preconditions\n    - Eclipse 4.x\n\n    - Atleast Java 7 Runtime (for starting eclipse with CobiGen). This is independent from the target version of your developed code\n\n1.2. Installation steps\n    * Open the eclipse installation dialog\n    menu bar → Help → Install new Software\n \n\nimage::images/01-install-new-software.png[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Select Update Site\nHere you can select the updates.\n    2. Open CobiGen’s update site\n\n \n\nimage::images/02-select-update-site.png[]\n\n    Insert the update site of your interest into the filed Work with and press Add\n    Stable releases: https://dl.bintray.com/devonfw/cobigen.p2/\n\n    * Follow the installation wizard\n    Select CobiGen Eclipse Plug-in → Next → Next → accept the license → Finish → OK → Yes\n\n    * Once installed, a new menu entry named &#34;CobiGen&#34; will show up in the Package Explorer’s context menu. In the sub menu there will the Generate​ command, which may ask you to update the templates, and then you can start the generation wizard of CobiGen. \n    \n    * You can adapt the templates by clicking on Adapt Templates which will give you the possibility to import the CobiGen_Templates automatically so that you can modified them.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Checkout (clone) your project’s templates folder or use the current templates released with CobiGen (https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/tree/master/cobigen-templates) and then choose \nImport -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace to import the templates into your workspace.\n\n\n== CobiGen Usage - Simple Mode\n \n\n    Selecting the menu entry Generate​ the generation wizard will be opened.\n    \n    The left side of the wizard shows all available increments, which can be selected to be generated. Increments are a container like concept encompassing multiple files to be generated, which should result in a semantically closed generation output. The type of modification of each file will be encoded into following color scheme if the files are selected for generation:\n\n    - green: files, which are currently non-existent in the file system. These files will be created during generation\n\n    - yellow: files, which are currently existent in the file system and which are configured to be merged with generated contents.\n\n    - red: files, which are currently existent in the file system. These files will be overwritten if manually selected.\n\n    - no color: files, which are currently existent in the file system. Additionally files, which were unselected and thus will be ignored during generation.\n\nimage::images/03-simple-mode-usage.png[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== CobiGen Usage - Batch Mode\n \n\nIf there are multiple input elements selected, e.g., Java files, CobiGen will be started in batch mode. The generation preview will be constrained to the first selected input element. It does not preview the generation for each element of the selection or of a complex input. The selection of the files to be generated will be generated for each input element analogously afterwards.\n\nThus the color encoding differs also a little bit:\n\n    - yellow: files, which are configured to be merged.\n\n    - red: files, which are not configured with any merge strategy and thus will be created if the file does not exist or overwritten if the file already exists\n\n    - no color: files, which will be ignored during generation\n\nimage::images/04-batch-mode-usage.png[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==  \n \n\n## Health Check\nHowever, you might face some errors while using CobiGen. So, we recommend to perform a Health Check for CobiGen Templates for better experience.\n\nTo get more information on Health Check for CobiGen Templates visit on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc_eclipse-integration.html#cobigen-eclipse_usage.asciidoc_health-check\n\n## Troubleshooting CLI\nWhen generating code from a Java file, CobiGen makes use of Java reflection for generating templates. In order to do that, the CLI needs to find the compiled source code of your project.\n\nIf you find an error like Compiled class foo\\bar\\EmployeeEntity.java has not been found, it means you need to run &#34;mvn clean install&#34; on the input project so that a new target folder gets created with the needed compiled sources.\n\n## Conclusion\nFrom this tutorial you have learned the following:\n* You can do CobiGen set up in your system.\n* You can use the CobiGen CLI commands to generate the code.\n* You can now integrate CobiGen with Eclipse and generate your crud services.\n* Now you know how to use CobiGen in a particular project with Eclipse as well as CLI.\n\nMore information about CobiGen on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-cobigen.asciidoc.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Errors can be reported by creating an issue in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/issues[tutorials repository]. To fix the error fork the repository and create a pull request. Errors in the wiki can be reported and fixed in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler[Tutorial-compiler repository].\nYou can find a description of what to look for when creating a pull request at the devonfw contribution guide: https://devonfw.com/website/pages/community/community.html#community.asciidoc_contributing-to-devonfw. If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.\n\n== Fork the tutorials repository\n# Setup your workspace\nLet's start!\n\nFirst of all, go to the tutorials repository on GitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials\n\nFork the repository by clicking on the 'Fork' button.\nThis will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. You will find it in 'Your repositories'.\n\n \n\nimage::images/fork.jpg[]\n\n\nOpen the forked repository in your GitHub account and copy the repository URL as shown in image below.\n\n\nimage::images/clone_code.jpg[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Clone the repository \n=== Clone Repository\nPaste the URL to the 'git clone' command to clone the repostitory. For this tutorial we will use the original tutorials repository of the 'devonfw-tutorials' GitHub account to show the workflow of creating the tutorial.\n\nWhen you run the command on your machine, you will of course need to customize the URL and add your personal GitHub name. So the command will be `git clone https://github.com/YourName/tutorials.git`.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.\n\n==== Download\nOpen a terminal in your current workspace.\n\nFirstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to.\nIf the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal.\nIn this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/`.\n\nAfter that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/` in the terminal.\n\nTo clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials.git` in the terminal.\n\n\n\n== Create a new branch\n \n\nCreate a new branch inside the cloned repository.\n\nNavigate into the tutorials directory.\n\n`cd tutorials`{{execute T1}}\n\nCreate a new branch for your tutorial and switch into this branch.\n\n`git branch tutorial/myOwnTutorial`{{execute T1}}\n\n`git checkout tutorial/myOwnTutorial`{{execute T1}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can start to create the tutorial. This will be shown in the next steps.\n\n\n== Create the index.asciidoc file\n# Create the tutorial\n\nEach tutorial is located in its own directory and consists of an asciidoc file, in which the tutorial is specified. The file is always named 'index.asciidoc'.\n\nSo create a new folder in inside the tutorials directory and the file for the tutorial.\n \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* Any Editor that can edit files\n\n==== Creating index.asciidoc in any Editor\n\nCreate index.asciidoc in any Editor.\n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work.\nThe editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file that can be edited now.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *tutorials/myTutorial/index.asciidoc*. \nSelect the directory `tutorials/myTutorial`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `index.asciidoc` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and index.asciidoc has been created.\n\n\n== Create a pull request\n \n\nBefore starting write content into the tutorial, you have to create a pull request from your newly created branch into the main repository.\nThis has the advantage that your tutorial will automatically be build and pushed to https://katacoda.com/devonfw-dev. So you can directly test it.\n\nFor this step you need to open you local terminal at your forked and cloned &#39;tutorials&#39; folder and run the following commands:\n1. &#39;git add .&#39; \n2. &#39;git commit -m &#34;initial commit for tutorial myTutorial&#34;&#39;\n3. &#39;git push&#39;\n\nThis will save all the changes and push them into your tutorials GitHub repository. \n\nSwitch to your browser and open:\nhttps://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials\n\nClick on &#39;Pull requests&#39; &gt; &#39;New pull request&#39;.\n\n\nimage::images/pull_request.jpg[]\n\n\nYou might have to click on &#39;compare across forks&#39;.\n\n\nimage::images/compare.jpg[]\n\n\nSelect\n\n    * base repository: devonfw-tutorials\n    * base: main\n    * head repository: [your username]/tutorials\n    * compare: [your branch name]\n\nand finally create the pull request by clicking on &#39;Create pull request&#39;.\n\nWrite &#39;WIP:&#39; in front of the pull request title to show that you are still working on this pull request. &#39;WIP&#39; stands for &#39;Work In Progress&#39;.\n\nA workflow in the tutorials repository will build the tutorial. Currently the pipeline will fails because a tutorial must contain at least a title, a description and one step.\n\nLet&#39;s fix that and fill the tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Add the title \n=== Changing of the index.asciidoc file\nThe syntax in which the tutorial is written can be found at https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.\n\nAt first we will add a title to the first line of the file.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of index.asciidoc in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file index.asciidoc, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.asciidoc and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `tutorials/myTutorial` and select the file `index.asciidoc`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner index.asciidoc will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, asciidoc]\n----\n= Title of my new tutorial\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened index.asciidoc. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.asciidoc has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Add the description \n=== Changing of the index.asciidoc file\nThe next step is to add some description lines below the title. The description has to be surrounded by `====`.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of index.asciidoc in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file index.asciidoc, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.asciidoc and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `tutorials/myTutorial` and select the file `index.asciidoc`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner index.asciidoc will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, asciidoc]\n----\n= Title of my new tutorial\n====\nIn this section you can write the description of the tutorial. This can consist of several lines.\n\nThe description should explain the tutorial in a few words and explain what is to be learned.\n====\n\n----\n\n\nTo replace the content with a specific placeholder you have to locate the placeholder in the file. The fastest way is to search through the opened file and replace *= Title of my new tutorial* with the new content.\n\nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.asciidoc has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Add a step \n=== Changing of the index.asciidoc file\nLast but not least add a step. \n\nEach step consists of\n\n* an explanation\n* a function to execute (You can find a list with the currently available functions on https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler/wiki/Functions)\n* and an optional explanation of the results of the step.\n\nIn this tutorial we will add a simple step which creates a new file.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of index.asciidoc in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file index.asciidoc, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.asciidoc and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `tutorials/myTutorial` and select the file `index.asciidoc`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner index.asciidoc will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, asciidoc]\n----\n= Title of my new tutorial\n====\nIn this section you can write the description of the tutorial. This can consist of several lines.\n\nThe description should explain the tutorial in a few words and explain what is to be learned.\n====\n\nBefore the '[step]' keyword the explanation is written.\nThe explanation can consist of multiple lines.\n[step]\n--\ncreateFile(\"pathToTheFile/fileName.txt\")\n--\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened index.asciidoc. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.asciidoc has been changed.\n\nThis is the syntax without additional text after the step. There is an alternative syntax to display a text after the step (e.g. for describing the results of a step). This will be shown in the next step.\n\n\n== Alternative syntax\n \n\nIf you want to add some additional text after the step to explain the results of a step then you have to use the following syntax.\n\n```\n====\nThe explanation for the step\n[step]\n--\nfunctionName(parameters)\n--\nThe explanation of the results\n====\n```\n\nHere the whole block has to be surrounded by `====`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Push tutorial\n \n\nYou now have a working tutorial.\n\nPush the changes again to GitHub by executing the following commands:\n\n1. &#39;git add .&#39; \n2. &#39;git commit -m &#34;added createFile step to the tutorial&#34;&#39;\n3. &#39;git push&#39;\n\nThis will automatically start the workflow in the tutorials repository.\n\nAfter a while you can find your tutorial on https://katacoda.com/devonfw-dev.\n\nAfter you have completed your tutorial and tested it on the katacoda account, remove the &#39;WIP&#39; from your pull request to show that the tutorial is finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Local testing\n \n\nNow you should have a ideo how to create your own tutorials.\n\nThere is also a way to test your tutorials on your local machine. For this you have to clone the tutorial-compiler repository.\n\nThe directory with the tutorial-compiler has to be located next to the directory with the tutorials repository.\n\nSo go back to the root directory and clone the repository.\n\n`cd /root`{{execute T1}}\n\n`git clone https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler.git`{{execute T1}}\n\nThe tutorial-compiler needs typescript to be installed to work. So install typescript on your machine.\n\n`npm install typescript -g`{{execute T1}}\n\nNow navigate into the tutorial-compiler directory and install the needed dependencies.\n\n`cd tutorial-compiler`{{execute T1}}\n\n`npm install`{{execute T1}}\n\n\n# Test your tutorial locally\nTo run the tutorial-compiler execute the following command:\n\n`bash localBuildRun.sh -e katacoda -p myTutorial`{{execute T1}}\n\nThis will execute your newly create tutorial in the &#39;katacoda&#39; environment. If you obmit the &#39;-e&#39; and &#39;-p&#39; paramter, all tutorials are executed in all environments.\n\nThe tutorial-compiler now generates the files needed for a katacoda tutorial. You can find the files in the &#39;build/output/katacoda/myTutorial&#39; directory of the tutorial compiler.\nThe step you added to your tutorial is shown in the following file:\n\n`tutorial-compiler/build/output/katacoda/myTutorial/step1.md`{{open}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* Any Editor that can edit files\n\n==== Creating index.asciidoc in any Editor\n\nCreate index.asciidoc in any Editor.\n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work.\nThe editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file that can be edited now.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *tutorials/myTutorial/index.asciidoc*. \nSelect the directory `tutorials/myTutorial`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `index.asciidoc` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and index.asciidoc has been created.\n\n\n== Create a pull request\n \n\nBefore starting write content into the tutorial, you have to create a pull request from your newly created branch into the main repository.\nThis has the advantage that your tutorial will automatically be build and pushed to https://katacoda.com/devonfw-dev. So you can directly test it.\n\nFor this step you need to open you local terminal at your forked and cloned &#39;tutorials&#39; folder and run the following commands:\n1. &#39;git add .&#39; \n2. &#39;git commit -m &#34;initial commit for tutorial myTutorial&#34;&#39;\n3. &#39;git push&#39;\n\nThis will save all the changes and push them into your tutorials GitHub repository. \n\nSwitch to your browser and open:\nhttps://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials\n\nClick on &#39;Pull requests&#39; &gt; &#39;New pull request&#39;.\n\n\nimage::images/pull_request.jpg[]\n\n\nYou might have to click on &#39;compare across forks&#39;.\n\n\nimage::images/compare.jpg[]\n\n\nSelect\n\n    * base repository: devonfw-tutorials\n    * base: main\n    * head repository: [your username]/tutorials\n    * compare: [your branch name]\n\nand finally create the pull request by clicking on &#39;Create pull request&#39;.\n\nWrite &#39;WIP:&#39; in front of the pull request title to show that you are still working on this pull request. &#39;WIP&#39; stands for &#39;Work In Progress&#39;.\n\nA workflow in the tutorials repository will build the tutorial. Currently the pipeline will fails because a tutorial must contain at least a title, a description and one step.\n\nLet&#39;s fix that and fill the tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Add the title \n=== Changing of the index.asciidoc file\nThe syntax in which the tutorial is written can be found at https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.\n\nAt first we will add a title to the first line of the file.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of index.asciidoc in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file index.asciidoc, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.asciidoc and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `tutorials/myTutorial` and select the file `index.asciidoc`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner index.asciidoc will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, asciidoc]\n----\n= Title of my new tutorial\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened index.asciidoc. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.asciidoc has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Add the description \n=== Changing of the index.asciidoc file\nThe next step is to add some description lines below the title. The description has to be surrounded by `====`.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of index.asciidoc in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file index.asciidoc, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.asciidoc and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `tutorials/myTutorial` and select the file `index.asciidoc`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner index.asciidoc will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, asciidoc]\n----\n= Title of my new tutorial\n====\nIn this section you can write the description of the tutorial. This can consist of several lines.\n\nThe description should explain the tutorial in a few words and explain what is to be learned.\n====\n\n----\n\n\nTo replace the content with a specific placeholder you have to locate the placeholder in the file. The fastest way is to search through the opened file and replace *= Title of my new tutorial* with the new content.\n\nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.asciidoc has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Add a step \n=== Changing of the index.asciidoc file\nLast but not least add a step. \n\nEach step consists of\n\n* an explanation\n* a function to execute (You can find a list with the currently available functions on https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler/wiki/Functions)\n* and an optional explanation of the results of the step.\n\nIn this tutorial we will add a simple step which creates a new file.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of index.asciidoc in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file index.asciidoc, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.asciidoc and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `tutorials/myTutorial` and select the file `index.asciidoc`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner index.asciidoc will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, asciidoc]\n----\n= Title of my new tutorial\n====\nIn this section you can write the description of the tutorial. This can consist of several lines.\n\nThe description should explain the tutorial in a few words and explain what is to be learned.\n====\n\nBefore the '[step]' keyword the explanation is written.\nThe explanation can consist of multiple lines.\n[step]\n--\ncreateFile(\"pathToTheFile/fileName.txt\")\n--\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened index.asciidoc. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.asciidoc has been changed.\n\nThis is the syntax without additional text after the step. There is an alternative syntax to display a text after the step (e.g. for describing the results of a step). This will be shown in the next step.\n\n\n== Alternative syntax\n \n\nIf you want to add some additional text after the step to explain the results of a step then you have to use the following syntax.\n\n```\n====\nThe explanation for the step\n[step]\n--\nfunctionName(parameters)\n--\nThe explanation of the results\n====\n```\n\nHere the whole block has to be surrounded by `====`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Push tutorial\n \n\nYou now have a working tutorial.\n\nPush the changes again to GitHub by executing the following commands:\n\n1. &#39;git add .&#39; \n2. &#39;git commit -m &#34;added createFile step to the tutorial&#34;&#39;\n3. &#39;git push&#39;\n\nThis will automatically start the workflow in the tutorials repository.\n\nAfter a while you can find your tutorial on https://katacoda.com/devonfw-dev.\n\nAfter you have completed your tutorial and tested it on the katacoda account, remove the &#39;WIP&#39; from your pull request to show that the tutorial is finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Local testing\n \n\nNow you should have a ideo how to create your own tutorials.\n\nThere is also a way to test your tutorials on your local machine. For this you have to clone the tutorial-compiler repository.\n\nThe directory with the tutorial-compiler has to be located next to the directory with the tutorials repository.\n\nSo go back to the root directory and clone the repository.\n\n`cd /root`{{execute T1}}\n\n`git clone https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler.git`{{execute T1}}\n\nThe tutorial-compiler needs typescript to be installed to work. So install typescript on your machine.\n\n`npm install typescript -g`{{execute T1}}\n\nNow navigate into the tutorial-compiler directory and install the needed dependencies.\n\n`cd tutorial-compiler`{{execute T1}}\n\n`npm install`{{execute T1}}\n\n\n# Test your tutorial locally\nTo run the tutorial-compiler execute the following command:\n\n`bash localBuildRun.sh -e katacoda -p myTutorial`{{execute T1}}\n\nThis will execute your newly create tutorial in the &#39;katacoda&#39; environment. If you obmit the &#39;-e&#39; and &#39;-p&#39; paramter, all tutorials are executed in all environments.\n\nThe tutorial-compiler now generates the files needed for a katacoda tutorial. You can find the files in the &#39;build/output/katacoda/myTutorial&#39; directory of the tutorial compiler.\nThe step you added to your tutorial is shown in the following file:\n\n`tutorial-compiler/build/output/katacoda/myTutorial/step1.md`{{open}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Errors can be reported by creating an issue in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/issues[tutorials repository]. To fix the error fork the repository and create a pull request. Errors in the wiki can be reported and fixed in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler[Tutorial-compiler repository].\nYou can find a description of what to look for when creating a pull request at the devonfw contribution guide: https://devonfw.com/website/pages/community/community.html#community.asciidoc_contributing-to-devonfw. If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.\n\n== devonfw setup\n \n\nIf you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n\nThe installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.\n \n\n\n\n== Create a new devon4j project from command promt\n### A devon4j Sample Application\n\nNote: Startup script will take some time for set up. After that you can proceed further.\n\nIf you want to create devon4j application on your local machine there are two ways to do it:\n\n* In eclipse as shown [here](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html#tutorial-newapp.asciidoc_from-eclipse)\n\n* Using command line as shown [here](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html#tutorial-newapp.asciidoc_from-command-line)\n\nNow, you will create sample devon4j application with name *sampleapp*. This step will guide you on how to do it.\n\n\n \n\n==== Prerequisites\n\nIn order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype functionality].\n\nTo create a new application, you should have installed devonfw-ide. Follow the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html[devonfw-ide] documentation to install the same.\n\n==== Create the project\n\nNow you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command in terminal.\n\n`devon java create com.example.application.sampleapp`\n\nThere is also is also an alternative way, where you can customize the project setup with optional parameters. More informations you will find https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html[here].\n\n==== What is generated?\n\nThe application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:\n\n- *api*: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transfer-objects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.\n\n- *core*: maven module containing the core of the application.\n\n- *batch*: optional module for batch(es)\n\n- *server*: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) as a WAR file.\n\n- *ear*: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.\n\nThe toplevel pom.xml of the generated project has the following features:\n\n- Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.\n\n- Modules definition for the modules (described above)\n\n- Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.\n\n- Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration\n\n- Profiles for https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]\n\nOnce sampleapp is created switch to next tab of IDE. In IDE explorer you can see folder structure like devonfw-> workspaces->main->sampleapp . \n\nSampleapp contains 3 modules i.e api, core and server.\n\n**api**: It contains API for sampleapp.The API contains the required artifacts to interact with your application via remote services. This can be REST service interfaces, transfer-objects with their interfaces and datatypes but also OpenAPI or gRPC contracts.\n\n**core**: It is the core of the application.In this module you can write actual business logic with service implementation, as well as entire logic layer and dataaccess layer.\n\n**batch**: Optional module for batch layer. In this example we have not created it. To add batch module while generating from commandline use -Dbatch=batch parameter. And to generate it from eclipse using maven archetype, enter batch variable value as batch in project creation page.\n\n**server**: This module bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) typically as a bootified WAR file.\n\nIf you want to know more about modules and project structure refer [here](#https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-structure.asciidoc#project-structure).\n\n\n== devon4j multilayer architecture\n \n\nimage::images/devon4j_proj_structure1.jpg[]\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in above image, devon4j application follows [multilayered architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture).\n\nEach component is divided into following layers:\n\n* [client layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-client-layer.asciidoc) for the front-end (GUI).\n\n* [service layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-service-layer.asciidoc) for the services used to expose functionality of the back-end to the client or other consumers. For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<componentname>.service.impl will have all rest service implementation.\n\n* [batch layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-batch-layer.asciidoc) for exposing functionality in batch-processes (e.g. mass imports).\n\n* [logic layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-logic-layer.asciidoc) for the business logic. For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<componentname>.logic will contain business logic or usecase implementation.\n\n* [data-access layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-dataaccess-layer.asciidoc) for the data access (esp. persistence).For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<componentname>.dataaccess will contain entity, repositories etc.\n\n\n== Build the Java project with Maven\nNow you have to build a devon4j sample application i.e. sampleapp.\n\n \n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have Maven installed. If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].\n\n==== Execution\n\nNow move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/sampleapp` in the terminal.\nNext, use the following command to build the java project.\n\n`mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`\n\nThe maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state.\nInstall will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.\n\nWe do not need to execute the test cases, so we can skip them by using the option '-Dmaven.test.skip=true'.\n\n\nOnce build is successful you will get bootified-war generated in server module target folder. In sampleapp check for path sampleapp/server/sampleapp-server-bootified.war\n\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial you have learnt how to create devon4j application using command line or via Eclipse. Next you can check for other tutorials such as:\n \n \n* devon4j- contract first code generation\n \n \n* devon4j-Kafka\n \n \n* devon4j-security\n \n \n* devon4j with Spring JPA\n \n \n* devon4j rest services\n \n \n",

After that you can proceed further.\n\nIf you want to create devon4j application on your local machine there are two ways to do it:\n\n* In eclipse as shown [here](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html#tutorial-newapp.asciidoc_from-eclipse)\n\n* Using command line as shown [here](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html#tutorial-newapp.asciidoc_from-command-line)\n\nNow, you will create sample devon4j application with name *sampleapp*. This step will guide you on how to do it.\n\n\n \n\n==== Prerequisites\n\nIn order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype functionality].\n\nTo create a new application, you should have installed devonfw-ide. Follow the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html[devonfw-ide] documentation to install the same.\n\n==== Create the project\n\nNow you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command in terminal.\n\n`devon java create com.example.application.sampleapp`\n\nThere is also is also an alternative way, where you can customize the project setup with optional parameters. More informations you will find https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html[here].\n\n==== What is generated?\n\nThe application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:\n\n- *api*: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transfer-objects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.\n\n- *core*: maven module containing the core of the application.\n\n- *batch*: optional module for batch(es)\n\n- *server*: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) as a WAR file.\n\n- *ear*: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.\n\nThe toplevel pom.xml of the generated project has the following features:\n\n- Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.\n\n- Modules definition for the modules (described above)\n\n- Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.\n\n- Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration\n\n- Profiles for https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]\n\nOnce sampleapp is created switch to next tab of IDE. In IDE explorer you can see folder structure like devonfw-> workspaces->main->sampleapp . \n\nSampleapp contains 3 modules i.e api, core and server.\n\n**api**: It contains API for sampleapp.The API contains the required artifacts to interact with your application via remote services. This can be REST service interfaces, transfer-objects with their interfaces and datatypes but also OpenAPI or gRPC contracts.\n\n**core**: It is the core of the application.In this module you can write actual business logic with service implementation, as well as entire logic layer and dataaccess layer.\n\n**batch**: Optional module for batch layer. In this example we have not created it. To add batch module while generating from commandline use -Dbatch=batch parameter. And to generate it from eclipse using maven archetype, enter batch variable value as batch in project creation page.\n\n**server**: This module bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) typically as a bootified WAR file.\n\nIf you want to know more about modules and project structure refer [here](#https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-structure.asciidoc#project-structure).\n\n\n== devon4j multilayer architecture\n \n\nimage::images/devon4j_proj_structure1.jpg[]\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in above image, devon4j application follows [multilayered architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture).\n\nEach component is divided into following layers:\n\n* [client layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-client-layer.asciidoc) for the front-end (GUI).\n\n* [service layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-service-layer.asciidoc) for the services used to expose functionality of the back-end to the client or other consumers. For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<componentname>.service.impl will have all rest service implementation.\n\n* [batch layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-batch-layer.asciidoc) for exposing functionality in batch-processes (e.g. mass imports).\n\n* [logic layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-logic-layer.asciidoc) for the business logic. For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<componentname>.logic will contain business logic or usecase implementation.\n\n* [data-access layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-dataaccess-layer.asciidoc) for the data access (esp. persistence).For example, in sampleapp we generated com.example.application.sampleapp.<componentname>.dataaccess will contain entity, repositories etc.\n\n\n== Build the Java project with Maven\nNow you have to build a devon4j sample application i.e. sampleapp.\n\n \n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have Maven installed. If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].\n\n==== Execution\n\nNow move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/sampleapp` in the terminal.\nNext, use the following command to build the java project.\n\n`mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`\n\nThe maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state.\nInstall will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.\n\nWe do not need to execute the test cases, so we can skip them by using the option '-Dmaven.test.skip=true'.\n\n\nOnce build is successful you will get bootified-war generated in server module target folder. In sampleapp check for path sampleapp/server/sampleapp-server-bootified.war\n\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial you have learnt how to create devon4j application using command line or via Eclipse. Next you can check for other tutorials such as:\n \n \n* devon4j- contract first code generation\n \n \n* devon4j-Kafka\n \n \n* devon4j-security\n \n \n* devon4j with Spring JPA\n \n \n* devon4j rest services\n \n \n"

Errors can be reported by creating an issue in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/issues[tutorials repository]. To fix the error fork the repository and create a pull request. Errors in the wiki can be reported and fixed in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler[Tutorial-compiler repository].\nYou can find a description of what to look for when creating a pull request at the devonfw contribution guide: https://devonfw.com/website/pages/community/community.html#community.asciidoc_contributing-to-devonfw. If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.\n\n== devonfw setup\n### setup environment\nWe will start by setting up development environment.\n\n \n\nIf you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n \n\n\n\n== Clone Repository\n### Clone jump the queue repository\n\nFirst, clone the Jump-The-Queue Repository.Jump the queue is a sample devonfw application.\n \n\n==== Prerequisites\n* You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.\n\n==== Download\nOpen a terminal in your current workspace.\n\nFirstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to.\nIf the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal.\nIn this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.\n\nAfter that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.\n\nTo clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/devonfw/jump-the-queue.git` in the terminal.\n\nOnce project is cloned switch to next tab of IDE. In IDE explorer you will be able to see folder structure like devonfw-> workspaces->main->jump-the-queue-> java->jtqj \n\n\n== devon4j application architecture\n### devon4j application structure\n \n\nimage::images/jtqj_app_structure.jpg[]\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, jump-the-queue contains 3 modules i.e api, core and server.\n\n**api**: It contains API for sampleapp.The API contains the required artifacts to interact with your application via remote services. This can be REST service interfaces, transfer-objects with their interfaces and datatypes but also OpenAPI or gRPC contracts.\n\n**core**: It is the core of the application.In this module you can write actual business logic with service implementation, as well as entire logic layer and dataaccess layer.\n\n**batch**: optional module for batch layer. In this example we have not created it.\n\n**server**: This module bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) typically as a bootified WAR file.\n\nIf you want to know more about modules and project structure refer [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-structure.asciidoc#project-structure).\n\ndevon4j application follows [multilayered architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture). We will understand more about it in next step.\n\n\n\n== devon4j application layers\n### devon4j layers explained\n\n \n\nimage::images/jtqj_detailed_app_structure.jpg[]\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove image display detailed structure of devon4j application. As shown above jump-the-queue application contains different components like queuemanagement, visitormanagement etc\n\nEach component is divided into following layers:\n* [client layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-client-layer.asciidoc) for the front-end (GUI).\n\n* [service layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-service-layer.asciidoc) for the services used to expose functionality of the back-end to the client or other consumers. \nFor example, in jtqj-api->queuemangement->service->api-> rest contains interfaces for rest services. In core module jtqj-core->queuemanagement->service->impl-> rest you will be able to see implementation of service.\n\n* [batch layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-batch-layer.asciidoc) for exposing functionality in batch-processes (e.g. mass imports).\n\n* [logic layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-logic-layer.asciidoc) for the business logic.\nFor example, in jtqj-api->queuemangement->logic->api contains ETO(Entity Transfer Object) , CTO(Composite Transfer object), some logic interfaces. In core module jtqj-core->queuemanagement->logic->impl you will be able to see usecase implementation.\n\n* [data-access layer](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-dataaccess-layer.asciidoc) for the data access (esp. persistence).\nFor example, in jtqj-api->queuemangement->dataaccess->core contains entities, spring data repositories etc\n\n\n\n== Understand devon4j application architecture\n \n\n### Key Principles:\ndevon4j application follows some fundamental principles  for all decisions about architecture, design, or choosing standards, libraries, and frameworks. \nIt follows key principles such as KISS, open,patterns, solid. More detils can be found [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#key-principles).\n\n### Architecture Principles:\nAdditionally devon4j architecture is based on [architecture principles](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#architecture-principles) such as Component Oriented Design, Homogeneity.\n\n### Application Architecture:\n\nFor the architecture of an application we distinguish the following views:\n\n* The **Business Architecture** describes an application from the business perspective. It divides the application into business components and with full abstraction of technical aspects.\n\n* The **Technical Architecture** describes an application from the technical implementation perspective. It divides the application into technical layers and defines which technical products and frameworks are used to support these layers.\n\n* The **Infrastructure Architecture** describes an application from the operational infrastructure perspective. It defines the nodes used to run the application including clustering, load-balancing and networking. This view is not explored further in this guide.\n\nDetailed description about devon4j business and technical architecture can be found [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#application-architecture)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo summarize, in this tutorial we learned about devon4j architecture and key principle it follows. with help of example we also learned about devon4j different modules such as api, core ,server and its multilayered architecture.\n\nNext you can visit following tutorials to know more about devon4j:\n \n* Java backend code generation using CobiGen (Code Generator)\n \n* devon4j- contract first code generation\n \n* devon4j-Kafka\n \n* devon4j-security\n \n* devon4j with Spring JPA\n \n* devon4j rest services\n \n",

More detils can be found [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#key-principles).\n\n### Architecture Principles:\nAdditionally devon4j architecture is based on [architecture principles](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#architecture-principles) such as Component Oriented Design, Homogeneity.\n\n### Application Architecture:\n\nFor the architecture of an application we distinguish the following views:\n\n* The **Business Architecture** describes an application from the business perspective. It divides the application into business components and with full abstraction of technical aspects.\n\n* The **Technical Architecture** describes an application from the technical implementation perspective. It divides the application into technical layers and defines which technical products and frameworks are used to support these layers.\n\n* The **Infrastructure Architecture** describes an application from the operational infrastructure perspective. It defines the nodes used to run the application including clustering, load-balancing and networking. This view is not explored further in this guide.\n\nDetailed description about devon4j business and technical architecture can be found [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/architecture.asciidoc#application-architecture)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo summarize, in this tutorial we learned about devon4j architecture and key principle it follows. with help of example we also learned about devon4j different modules such as api, core ,server and its multilayered architecture.\n\nNext you can visit following tutorials to know more about devon4j:\n \n* Java backend code generation using CobiGen (Code Generator)\n \n* devon4j- contract first code generation\n \n* devon4j-Kafka\n \n* devon4j-security\n \n* devon4j with Spring JPA\n \n* devon4j rest services\n \n"

If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.\n\n== devonfw setup\n \n\nIf you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n \n\n\n\n== REST \n=== Create a new devon4j project from command promt\nREST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an inter-operable protocol for services that is more lightweight than SOAP.\r\n\r\nFor implementing REST services we use the JAX-RS standard. As an implementation we recommend CXF. For JSON bindings we use Jackson while XML binding works out-of-the-box with JAXB. To implement a service you write an interface with JAX-RS annotations for the API and a regular implementation class annotated with @Named to make it a spring-bean.\r\n\r\nThe REST service implementation is a regular CDI bean that can use dependency injection. The separation of the API as a Java interface allows to use it for service client calls.\r\n\r\n**Why** **Should** **you** **prefer** **devon4j** **client** **over** **other** **clients?**\r\n\r\ndevon4j supports flexible configuration, adding headers for authentication, mapping of errors from server, logging success/errors with duration for performance analysis, support for synchronous and asynchronous invocations. Easy invocation of service inside a micro-service.\r\nFor more details on REST visit https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-rest.asciidoc\r\n\r\nFor more details on devon4j Service Client https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-service-client.asciidoc\r\n\r\n## Create the devon4j REST SERVER\r\nAs explained in REST document, With JAX-RS it is important to make sure that each service method is annotated with the proper HTTP annotation(@GET, @POST, etc).\r\nLet's create devon4j server.\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\nIn order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype functionality].\n\nTo create a new application, you should have installed devonfw-ide. Follow the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html[devonfw-ide] documentation to install the same.\n\n==== Create the project\n\nNow you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command in terminal.\n\n`devon java create com.example.application.httprestserver`\n\nThere is also is also an alternative way, where you can customize the project setup with optional parameters. More informations you will find https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html[here].\n\n==== What is generated?\n\nThe application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:\n\n- *api*: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transfer-objects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.\n\n- *core*: maven module containing the core of the application.\n\n- *batch*: optional module for batch(es)\n\n- *server*: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) as a WAR file.\n\n- *ear*: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.\n\nThe toplevel pom.xml of the generated project has the following features:\n\n- Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.\n\n- Modules definition for the modules (described above)\n\n- Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.\n\n- Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration\n\n- Profiles for https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]\n\nIn next step, you will add configuration to allow basic authentication.\r\n\n\n== Add configuration to allow basic authentication \n=== Changing of the BaseWebSecurityConfig.java file\nNow, You have to modify BaseWebSecurityConfig file to allow application for basic authentication.\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of BaseWebSecurityConfig.java in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file BaseWebSecurityConfig.java, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to BaseWebSecurityConfig.java and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestserver/general/service/impl/config` and select the file `BaseWebSecurityConfig.java`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner BaseWebSecurityConfig.java will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, java]\n----\npackage com.example.application.httprestserver.general.service.impl.config;\r\n\r\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\r\nimport javax.servlet.Filter;\r\n\r\nimport org.springframework.security.config.annotation.authentication.builders.AuthenticationManagerBuilder;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailsService;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.authentication.SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.authentication.SimpleUrlAuthenticationSuccessHandler;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.authentication.logout.LogoutFilter;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.authentication.logout.SecurityContextLogoutHandler;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.authentication.www.BasicAuthenticationFilter;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.util.matcher.AntPathRequestMatcher;\r\n\r\nimport com.devonfw.module.security.common.api.config.WebSecurityConfigurer;\r\nimport com.devonfw.module.security.common.impl.rest.AuthenticationSuccessHandlerSendingOkHttpStatusCode;\r\nimport com.devonfw.module.security.common.impl.rest.JsonUsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter;\r\nimport com.devonfw.module.security.common.impl.rest.LogoutSuccessHandlerReturningOkHttpStatusCode;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * This type serves as a base class for extensions of the {@code WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter} and provides a default\r\n * configuration. <br/>\r\n * Security configuration is based on {@link WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter}.

(If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* Any Editor that can edit files\n\n==== Creating VisitormanagementRestService.java in any Editor\n\nCreate VisitormanagementRestService.java in any Editor and insert the following data into it. .\n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work.\nThe editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file that can be edited now.\n \nCopy the following text.\n[source, java]\n----\npackage com.example.application.httprestserver.visitormanagement.service.api.rest;\r\n\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.Consumes;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.GET;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.Path;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.Produces;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\r\n\r\n@Path(\"/visitormanagement/v1\")\r\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\n@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\npublic interface VisitormanagementRestService {\r\n\r\n  @GET\r\n  @Path(\"/clientrequest/\")\r\n  @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\n  @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\n  public String returnResponseToClient();\r\n\r\n}\n---- \nNow insert the copied text into the new file.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestserver/visitormanagement/service/api/rest/VisitormanagementRestService.java*. \nSelect the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestserver/visitormanagement/service/api/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `VisitormanagementRestService.java` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and VisitormanagementRestService.java has been created and filled with some data.\n\n\n== Create implementation class for Service \n=== Create the VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl.java file\nNow, you will create VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl, the implementation class of VisitormanagementRestService using JAX-RS standard.\r\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file.

Paste `VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl.java` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl.java has been created and filled with some data.\n\n\nHere , you can see \"VisitormanagementRestServiceImpl.java\" is annotated with @Named to make it a spring-bean. To get return response to client \"returnResponseToClient()\" can be accessed via HTTP GET under the URL path \"/visitormanagement/v1/clientrequest\".

Now, you have to start the build and then, start the server as mentioned below.\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have Maven installed. If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].\n\n==== Execution\n\nNow move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver` in the terminal.\nNext, use the following command to build the java project.\n\n`mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`\n\nThe maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state.\nInstall will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.\n\nWe do not need to execute the test cases, so we can skip them by using the option '-Dmaven.test.skip=true'.\n\n\n\n\n=== Run Java Server\n\n\n\n\n=== Prerequisites\n* Maven (can be included in your devonfw environment)\n\n=== Starting the server\n\nFirst, change the current working directory to where your server is located, i.e. `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/server`.\n\nAfterwards, use maven to start the server: `mvn spring-boot:run`.\nThis command will start the Java server.\n\n\n\n=== Startup Assertion\n\nYou can check if the server is running correctly by checking if `localhost:8081/httprestserver` is accessible by either using a tool like `curl`, `Postman` or simply accessing the service via your webbrowser.\n\nExample: `curl -Is localhost:8081/ | head -n 1`\n\nThis command should return an `200 OK` header if the service is available.\n\n\n\nOnce, Java server starts running. To test REST-server follow below steps:\r\n* Click on \"+\" next to terminal tab\r\n* Select \"select port to view host\"\r\n* Enter the port number \"8081\" \r\n* In the url, append \"/httprestserver/services/rest/visitormanagement/v1/clientrequest/\"\r\n* Enter username as \"admin\" and password as \"admin\"\r\n* You will be able to see response \"Welcome to REST API world\"\r\nIn next step, You have to create devon4j service Client.\r\n\n\n== Create devon4j REST Client \n=== Create a new devon4j project from command promt\nTo create devon4j service Client. First, You need to create a sample devon4j project.\r\n\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\nIn order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype functionality].\n\nTo create a new application, you should have installed devonfw-ide. Follow the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html[devonfw-ide] documentation to install the same.\n\n==== Create the project\n\nNow you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command in terminal.\n\n`devon java create com.example.application.httprestclient`\n\nThere is also is also an alternative way, where you can customize the project setup with optional parameters. More informations you will find https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html[here].\n\n==== What is generated?\n\nThe application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:\n\n- *api*: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transfer-objects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.\n\n- *core*: maven module containing the core of the application.\n\n- *batch*: optional module for batch(es)\n\n- *server*: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) as a WAR file.\n\n- *ear*: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.\n\nThe toplevel pom.xml of the generated project has the following features:\n\n- Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.\n\n- Modules definition for the modules (described above)\n\n- Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.\n\n- Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration\n\n- Profiles for https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]\n\nThen, You need to add required dependency to your application.\r\n\r\nSince in this tutorial you will build client on Synchronous call so, you have to add dependency for synchronous consuming REST services via Apache CXF (Java8+)\r\nYou will add below dependency in core folder pom.xml\r\n\r\n----\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>com.devonfw.java.starters</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>devon4j-starter-cxf-client-rest</artifactId>\r\n</dependency>\r\n\r\n----\r\n\n\n== Modify POM file \n=== Changing of the pom.xml file\nModify pom.xml as below:\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of pom.xml in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file pom.xml, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to pom.xml and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/core` and select the file `pom.xml`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner pom.xml will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<dependencies>\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.devonfw.java.starters</groupId>\n  <artifactId>devon4j-starter-cxf-client-rest</artifactId>\n</dependency> \n\n----\n\n\nTo replace the content with a specific placeholder you have to locate the placeholder in the file. The fastest way is to search through the opened file and replace *&lt;dependencies&gt;* with the new content.\n\nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and pom.xml has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Create service to invoke server \n=== Create the VisitormanagementRestService.java file\nNow, You will create a Java interface VisitormanagementRestService to invoke inside client.\r\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* Any Editor that can edit files\n\n==== Creating VisitormanagementRestService.java in any Editor\n\nCreate VisitormanagementRestService.java in any Editor and insert the following data into it. .\n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work.\nThe editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file that can be edited now.\n \nCopy the following text.\n[source, java]\n----\npackage com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.api.rest;\r\n\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.Consumes;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.GET;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.Path;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.Produces;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\r\n\r\n@Path(\"/visitormanagement/v1\")\r\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\n@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\npublic interface VisitormanagementRestService {\r\n\r\n  @GET\r\n  @Path(\"/clientrequest/\")\r\n  @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\n  @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\n  public String returnResponseToClient();\r\n\r\n}\n---- \nNow insert the copied text into the new file.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest/VisitormanagementRestService.java*. \nSelect the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `VisitormanagementRestService.java` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and VisitormanagementRestService.java has been created and filled with some data.\n\n\n== Create service for CXF REST Client \n=== Create the TestRestService.java file\nNow, you will create service for client i.e. TestRestService.java to provide functionality using JAX-RS standard.\r\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* Any Editor that can edit files\n\n==== Creating TestRestService.java in any Editor\n\nCreate TestRestService.java in any Editor and insert the following data into it. .\n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work.\nThe editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file that can be edited now.\n \nCopy the following text.\n[source, java]\n----\npackage com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.api.rest;\n\nimport javax.ws.rs.Consumes;\nimport javax.ws.rs.GET;\nimport javax.ws.rs.Path;\nimport javax.ws.rs.Produces;\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\n\n@Path(\"/testrest/v1\")\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\npublic interface TestRestService {\n\n  @GET\n  @Path(\"/response/\")\n  public String showResponse();\n\n  @GET\n  @Path(\"/verify/\")\n  public String verifyServiceWork();\n}\n\n---- \nNow insert the copied text into the new file.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest/TestRestService.java*. \nSelect the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `TestRestService.java` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and TestRestService.java has been created and filled with some data.\n\n\n== Create implementation class for client&#39;s service \n=== Create the TestRestServiceImpl.java file\nNow, you will create TestRestServiceImpl, the implementation class of TestRestService using JAX-RS standard.\r\n\r\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* Any Editor that can edit files\n\n==== Creating TestRestServiceImpl.java in any Editor\n\nCreate TestRestServiceImpl.java in any Editor and insert the following data into it. .\n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work.\nThe editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file that can be edited now.\n \nCopy the following text.\n[source, java]\n----\npackage com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.impl.rest;\n\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\nimport javax.inject.Named;\n\nimport com.devonfw.module.service.common.api.client.ServiceClientFactory;\nimport com.devonfw.module.service.common.api.client.config.ServiceClientConfigBuilder;\nimport com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.api.rest.TestRestService;\nimport com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.api.rest.VisitormanagementRestService;\n\n@Named(\"TestRestService\")\npublic class TestRestServiceImpl implements TestRestService {\n\n  @Inject\n  private ServiceClientFactory serviceClientFactory;\n\n  @Override\n  public String showResponse() {\n\n    String result = callSynchronous();\n    System.out.println(\"**********inside client method***********\");\n    System.out.println(result);\n    System.out.println(\"************Thank you for choosing devon4j ****************\");\n    return result;\n\n  }\n\n  private String callSynchronous() {\n\n    System.out.println(\"***********inside synchronous call************\");\n    VisitormanagementRestService visitormanagementRestService = this.serviceClientFactory.create(\n        VisitormanagementRestService.class,\n        new ServiceClientConfigBuilder().authBasic().userLogin(\"admin\").userPassword(\"admin\").buildMap());\n    // call of service over the wire, synchronously blocking until result is received or error occurred\n    String resultFromAPICall = visitormanagementRestService.returnResponseToClient();\n    System.out.println(\"************************got result from api\" + resultFromAPICall + \"***************\");\n    return resultFromAPICall;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String verifyServiceWork() {\n\n    return \"Verified... service is working\";\n  }\n\n}\n\n---- \nNow insert the copied text into the new file.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/impl/rest/TestRestServiceImpl.java*. \nSelect the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/impl/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `TestRestServiceImpl.java` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and TestRestServiceImpl.java has been created and filled with some data.\n\n\nAs you can see synchronous invocation of a service is very simple and type-safe. The actual call of showResponse will technically call the remote service(i.e. VisitormanagementRestService) over the wire ( via HTTP) including marshaling the arguments (converting String to JSON) and un-marshalling the result (e.g. converting the received JSON to String).\r\nHere in TestRestServiceImpl, there is a method \"callSynchronous\" which will call the VisitormanagementRestService and return the object of VisitormanagementRestService to visitormanagementRestService.\r\nWith visitormanagementRestService, it is calling the method \"returnResponseToClient()\" of server.\r\nThe response from server will be stored in \"resultFromAPICall\" as the return type of result is String.\r\nAfter getting response, you can handle the response further in your implementation. Here, you can see that response is getting handled in \"showResponse\" method.\r\n== Modify properties for server configuration \n=== Changing of the application.properties file\nAn application needs to be configurable in order to allow internal setup but also to allow externalized configuration of a deployed package (e.g. integration into runtime environment). \r\nNow, You need to modify the content of existing properties files and add configuration for Server.\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of application.properties in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file application.properties, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens.

If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].\n\n==== Execution\n\nNow move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient` in the terminal.\nNext, use the following command to build the java project.\n\n`mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`\n\nThe maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state.\nInstall will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.\n\nWe do not need to execute the test cases, so we can skip them by using the option '-Dmaven.test.skip=true'.\n\n\n* Once, application builds successfully. Open new terminal by clicking \"+\" and wait for it to load.\r\n* Now, Copy and execute below command to navigate into client server.\r\n  `cd devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/server`\r\n* Now, Copy and execute below command to start the application.\r\n  `devon mvn spring-boot:run`\r\n\r\nTo test Synchronous method, follow below steps.\r\n* Click on \"+\" next to terminal tab\r\n* Select \"select port to view host\"\r\n* Enter the port number \"8080\" \r\n* In the url, append \"/httprestclient/services/rest/testrest/v1/response/\"\r\n* Enter username as \"admin\" and password as \"admin\"\r\n* You will be able to see response \"Welcome to REST API world\"\r\n\n\n\nYou have successfully created devon4j CXF REST Client.\r\nFor more details on devon4j follow https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc.html\r\n\n",

Errors can be reported by creating an issue in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/issues[tutorials repository]. To fix the error fork the repository and create a pull request. Errors in the wiki can be reported and fixed in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler[Tutorial-compiler repository].\nYou can find a description of what to look for when creating a pull request at the devonfw contribution guide: https://devonfw.com/website/pages/community/community.html#community.asciidoc_contributing-to-devonfw. If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.\n\n== devonfw setup\n \n\nIf you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n \n\n\n\n== REST \n=== Create a new devon4j project from command promt\nREST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an inter-operable protocol for services that is more lightweight than SOAP.\r\n\r\nFor implementing REST services we use the JAX-RS standard. As an implementation we recommend CXF. For JSON bindings we use Jackson while XML binding works out-of-the-box with JAXB. To implement a service you write an interface with JAX-RS annotations for the API and a regular implementation class annotated with @Named to make it a spring-bean.\r\n\r\nThe REST service implementation is a regular CDI bean that can use dependency injection. The separation of the API as a Java interface allows to use it for service client calls.\r\n\r\n**Why** **Should** **you** **prefer** **devon4j** **client** **over** **other** **clients?**\r\n\r\ndevon4j supports flexible configuration, adding headers for authentication, mapping of errors from server, logging success/errors with duration for performance analysis, support for synchronous and asynchronous invocations. Easy invocation of service inside a micro-service.\r\nFor more details on REST visit https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-rest.asciidoc\r\n\r\nFor more details on devon4j Service Client https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-service-client.asciidoc\r\n\r\n## Create the devon4j REST SERVER\r\nAs explained in REST document, With JAX-RS it is important to make sure that each service method is annotated with the proper HTTP annotation(@GET, @POST, etc).\r\nLet's create devon4j server.\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\nIn order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype functionality].\n\nTo create a new application, you should have installed devonfw-ide. Follow the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html[devonfw-ide] documentation to install the same.\n\n==== Create the project\n\nNow you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command in terminal.\n\n`devon java create com.example.application.httprestserver`\n\nThere is also is also an alternative way, where you can customize the project setup with optional parameters. More informations you will find https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html[here].\n\n==== What is generated?\n\nThe application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:\n\n- *api*: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transfer-objects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.\n\n- *core*: maven module containing the core of the application.\n\n- *batch*: optional module for batch(es)\n\n- *server*: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) as a WAR file.\n\n- *ear*: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.\n\nThe toplevel pom.xml of the generated project has the following features:\n\n- Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.\n\n- Modules definition for the modules (described above)\n\n- Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.\n\n- Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration\n\n- Profiles for https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]\n\nIn next step, you will add configuration to allow basic authentication.\r\n\n\n== Add configuration to allow basic authentication \n=== Changing of the BaseWebSecurityConfig.java file\nNow, You have to modify BaseWebSecurityConfig file to allow application for basic authentication.\r\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of BaseWebSecurityConfig.java in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file BaseWebSecurityConfig.java, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to BaseWebSecurityConfig.java and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestserver/general/service/impl/config` and select the file `BaseWebSecurityConfig.java`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and BaseWebSecurityConfig.java will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, java]\n----\npackage com.example.application.httprestserver.general.service.impl.config;\r\n\r\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\r\nimport javax.servlet.Filter;\r\n\r\nimport org.springframework.security.config.annotation.authentication.builders.AuthenticationManagerBuilder;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailsService;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.authentication.SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.authentication.SimpleUrlAuthenticationSuccessHandler;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.authentication.logout.LogoutFilter;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.authentication.logout.SecurityContextLogoutHandler;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.authentication.www.BasicAuthenticationFilter;\r\nimport org.springframework.security.web.util.matcher.AntPathRequestMatcher;\r\n\r\nimport com.devonfw.module.security.common.api.config.WebSecurityConfigurer;\r\nimport com.devonfw.module.security.common.impl.rest.AuthenticationSuccessHandlerSendingOkHttpStatusCode;\r\nimport com.devonfw.module.security.common.impl.rest.JsonUsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter;\r\nimport com.devonfw.module.security.common.impl.rest.LogoutSuccessHandlerReturningOkHttpStatusCode;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * This type serves as a base class for extensions of the {@code WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter} and provides a default\r\n * configuration. <br/>\r\n * Security configuration is based on {@link WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter}.

Now, you have to start the build and then, start the server as mentioned below.\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have Maven installed. If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].\n\n==== Execution\n\nNow move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver` in the terminal.\nNext, use the following command to build the java project.\n\n`mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`\n\nThe maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state.\nInstall will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.\n\nWe do not need to execute the test cases, so we can skip them by using the option '-Dmaven.test.skip=true'.\n\n\n\n\n=== Run Java Server\n\n\n\n\n=== Prerequisites\n* Maven (can be included in your devonfw environment)\n\n=== Starting the server\n\nFirst, change the current working directory to where your server is located, i.e. `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestserver/server`.\n\nAfterwards, use maven to start the server: `mvn spring-boot:run`.\nThis command will start the Java server.\n\n\n\n=== Startup Assertion\n\nYou can check if the server is running correctly by checking if `localhost:8081/httprestserver` is accessible by either using a tool like `curl`, `Postman` or simply accessing the service via your webbrowser.\n\nExample: `curl -Is localhost:8081/ | head -n 1`\n\nThis command should return an `200 OK` header if the service is available.\n\n\n\nOnce, Java server starts running. To test REST-server follow below steps:\r\n* Click on \"+\" next to terminal tab\r\n* Select \"select port to view host\"\r\n* Enter the port number \"8081\" \r\n* In the url, append \"/httprestserver/services/rest/visitormanagement/v1/clientrequest/\"\r\n* Enter username as \"admin\" and password as \"admin\"\r\n* You will be able to see response \"Welcome to REST API world\"\r\nIn next step, You have to create devon4j service Client.\r\n\n\n== Create devon4j REST Client \n=== Create a new devon4j project from command promt\nTo create devon4j service Client. First, You need to create a sample devon4j project.\r\n\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\nIn order to create a new application you must use the archetype provided by devon4j which uses the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[maven archetype functionality].\n\nTo create a new application, you should have installed devonfw-ide. Follow the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html[devonfw-ide] documentation to install the same.\n\n==== Create the project\n\nNow you can use devonfw to setup a java project for you by executing the following devon command in terminal.\n\n`devon java create com.example.application.httprestclient`\n\nThere is also is also an alternative way, where you can customize the project setup with optional parameters. More informations you will find https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_tutorials.html[here].\n\n==== What is generated?\n\nThe application template (archetype) generates a Maven multi-module project. It has the following modules:\n\n- *api*: module with the API (REST service interfaces, transfer-objects, datatypes, etc.) to be imported by other apps as a maven dependency in order to invoke and consume the offered (micro)services.\n\n- *core*: maven module containing the core of the application.\n\n- *batch*: optional module for batch(es)\n\n- *server*: module that bundles the entire app (core with optional batch) as a WAR file.\n\n- *ear*: optional maven module is responsible to packaging the application as a EAR file.\n\nThe toplevel pom.xml of the generated project has the following features:\n\n- Properties definition: Spring-boot version, Java version, etc.\n\n- Modules definition for the modules (described above)\n\n- Dependency management: define versions for dependencies of the technology stack that are recommended and work together in a compatible way.\n\n- Maven plugins with desired versions and configuration\n\n- Profiles for https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc_guides.html#guide-testing.asciidoc[test stages]\n\nThen, You need to add required dependency to your application.\r\n\r\nSince in this tutorial you will build client on Synchronous call so, you have to add dependency for synchronous consuming REST services via Apache CXF (Java8+)\r\nYou will add below dependency in core folder pom.xml\r\n\r\n----\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>com.devonfw.java.starters</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>devon4j-starter-cxf-client-rest</artifactId>\r\n</dependency>\r\n\r\n----\r\n\n\n== Modify POM file \n=== Changing of the pom.xml file\nModify pom.xml as below:\r\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of pom.xml in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file pom.xml, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to pom.xml and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/core` and select the file `pom.xml`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and pom.xml will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<dependencies>\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.devonfw.java.starters</groupId>\n  <artifactId>devon4j-starter-cxf-client-rest</artifactId>\n</dependency> \n\n----\n\nTo replace the content with a specific placeholder you have to locate the placeholder in the file. The fastest way is to search through the opened file and replace *&lt;dependencies&gt;* with the new content.\n\nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and pom.xml has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Create service to invoke server \n=== Create the VisitormanagementRestService.java file\nNow, You will create a Java interface VisitormanagementRestService to invoke inside client.\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Creating VisitormanagementRestService.java in the VS Code Editor\n\nCreate VisitormanagementRestService.java in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it. \n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n. A new VS Code editor window will be opened with an untitled-1 filename.\n \nCopy the following text.\n[source, java]\n----\npackage com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.api.rest;\r\n\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.Consumes;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.GET;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.Path;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.Produces;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\r\n\r\n@Path(\"/visitormanagement/v1\")\r\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\n@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\npublic interface VisitormanagementRestService {\r\n\r\n  @GET\r\n  @Path(\"/clientrequest/\")\r\n  @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\n  @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\r\n  public String returnResponseToClient();\r\n\r\n}\n---- \nNow insert the copied text into the new file.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest/VisitormanagementRestService.java*. \nSelect the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `VisitormanagementRestService.java` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and VisitormanagementRestService.java has been created and filled with some content.\n\n\n\n== Create service for CXF REST Client \n=== Create the TestRestService.java file\nNow, you will create service for client i.e. TestRestService.java to provide functionality using JAX-RS standard.\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Creating TestRestService.java in the VS Code Editor\n\nCreate TestRestService.java in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it. \n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n. A new VS Code editor window will be opened with an untitled-1 filename.\n \nCopy the following text.\n[source, java]\n----\npackage com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.api.rest;\n\nimport javax.ws.rs.Consumes;\nimport javax.ws.rs.GET;\nimport javax.ws.rs.Path;\nimport javax.ws.rs.Produces;\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\n\n@Path(\"/testrest/v1\")\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\npublic interface TestRestService {\n\n  @GET\n  @Path(\"/response/\")\n  public String showResponse();\n\n  @GET\n  @Path(\"/verify/\")\n  public String verifyServiceWork();\n}\n\n---- \nNow insert the copied text into the new file.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest/TestRestService.java*. \nSelect the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/api/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/api/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `TestRestService.java` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and TestRestService.java has been created and filled with some content.\n\n\n\n== Create implementation class for client&#39;s service \n=== Create the TestRestServiceImpl.java file\nNow, you will create TestRestServiceImpl, the implementation class of TestRestService using JAX-RS standard.\r\n\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Creating TestRestServiceImpl.java in the VS Code Editor\n\nCreate TestRestServiceImpl.java in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it. \n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n. A new VS Code editor window will be opened with an untitled-1 filename.\n \nCopy the following text.\n[source, java]\n----\npackage com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.impl.rest;\n\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\nimport javax.inject.Named;\n\nimport com.devonfw.module.service.common.api.client.ServiceClientFactory;\nimport com.devonfw.module.service.common.api.client.config.ServiceClientConfigBuilder;\nimport com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.api.rest.TestRestService;\nimport com.example.application.httprestclient.general.service.api.rest.VisitormanagementRestService;\n\n@Named(\"TestRestService\")\npublic class TestRestServiceImpl implements TestRestService {\n\n  @Inject\n  private ServiceClientFactory serviceClientFactory;\n\n  @Override\n  public String showResponse() {\n\n    String result = callSynchronous();\n    System.out.println(\"**********inside client method***********\");\n    System.out.println(result);\n    System.out.println(\"************Thank you for choosing devon4j ****************\");\n    return result;\n\n  }\n\n  private String callSynchronous() {\n\n    System.out.println(\"***********inside synchronous call************\");\n    VisitormanagementRestService visitormanagementRestService = this.serviceClientFactory.create(\n        VisitormanagementRestService.class,\n        new ServiceClientConfigBuilder().authBasic().userLogin(\"admin\").userPassword(\"admin\").buildMap());\n    // call of service over the wire, synchronously blocking until result is received or error occurred\n    String resultFromAPICall = visitormanagementRestService.returnResponseToClient();\n    System.out.println(\"************************got result from api\" + resultFromAPICall + \"***************\");\n    return resultFromAPICall;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String verifyServiceWork() {\n\n    return \"Verified... service is working\";\n  }\n\n}\n\n---- \nNow insert the copied text into the new file.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/impl/rest/TestRestServiceImpl.java*. \nSelect the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/core/src/main/java/com/example/application/httprestclient/general/service/impl/rest`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `TestRestServiceImpl.java` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and TestRestServiceImpl.java has been created and filled with some content.\n\nAs you can see synchronous invocation of a service is very simple and type-safe. The actual call of showResponse will technically call the remote service(i.e. VisitormanagementRestService) over the wire ( via HTTP) including marshaling the arguments (converting String to JSON) and un-marshalling the result (e.g. converting the received JSON to String).\r\nHere in TestRestServiceImpl, there is a method \"callSynchronous\" which will call the VisitormanagementRestService and return the object of VisitormanagementRestService to visitormanagementRestService.\r\nWith visitormanagementRestService, it is calling the method \"returnResponseToClient()\" of server.\r\nThe response from server will be stored in \"resultFromAPICall\" as the return type of result is String.\r\nAfter getting response, you can handle the response further in your implementation. Here, you can see that response is getting handled in \"showResponse\" method.\r\n\n\n== Modify properties for server configuration \n=== Changing of the application.properties file\nAn application needs to be configurable in order to allow internal setup but also to allow externalized configuration of a deployed package (e.g. integration into runtime environment). \r\nNow, You need to modify the content of existing properties files and add configuration for Server.\r\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of application.properties in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file application.properties, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens.

If you want to deploy multiple applications to\r\n# the same container (not recommended by default) you need to ensure the WARs are extracted in webapps folder and locate\r\n# the config folder inside the WEB-INF/classes folder of the webapplication.\r\n\r\nserver.port=8080\r\nserver.servlet.context-path=/httprestclient\r\n\r\n# Datasource for accessing the database\r\n# See https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/develop/documentation/guide-configuration.asciidoc#security-configuration\r\n#jasypt.encryptor.password=none\r\n#spring.datasource.password=ENC(7CnHiadYc0Wh2FnWADNjJg==)\r\nspring.datasource.password=\r\nspring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:./.httprestclient;\r\n\r\n# print SQL to console for debugging (e.g. detect N+1 issues)\r\nspring.jpa.show-sql=true\r\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true\r\n\r\n# Enable JSON pretty printing\r\nspring.jackson.serialization.INDENT_OUTPUT=true\r\n\r\n# Flyway for Database Setup and Migrations\r\nspring.flyway.enabled=true\r\nspring.flyway.clean-on-validation-error=true\r\n\r\n# rest client setup\r\nservice.client.default.url=https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8081-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/httprestserver/services/rest\r\nservice.client.app.httprestserver.url=https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8081-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/httprestserver/services/rest\r\nservice.client.default.timeout.connection=120\r\nservice.client.default.timeout.response=3600\r\nservice.client.app.httprestserver.auth=basic\r\nservice.client.app.httprestserver.user.login=admin\r\nservice.client.app.httprestserver.user.password=admin\r\n\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened application.properties. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and application.properties has been changed.\n\n## Service Discovery\r\n**service.client.default.url** :- It is used to set the default url of server and it is added for service discovery.\r\n\r\n**service.client.app.httprestserver.url** :- This property provide base url of REST in your application. It follows format such as \"service.client.app.«application».url\". Here, «application» refers to the technical name of the application providing the service.\r\n\r\n## Timeouts\r\n**service.client.default.timeout.connection** :- It is used to set the default timeout for particular connection.\r\n\r\n**service.client.default.timeout.response** :- It is used to set the default timeout for particular response.\r\n\r\n## Headers\r\n**service.client.app.httprestserver.auth** :- It is used for customization of Service Header. Here it is used for basic authentication.\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\n**service.client.app.httprestserver.user.login** :- It is used to set username of server for authentication.\r\n\r\n**service.client.app.httprestserver.user.password** :- It is used to set password.\r\n\n\n== Build devon4j CXF REST Client \n=== Build the Java project with Maven\nNow, Let's build and start the service client application.\r\nThis might take some time for application to start.\r\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have Maven installed. If not already installed, you can download it https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here]. Alternativly, you can make use of the devonfw-ide, where you can install Maven directly to your workspace. For more details on how to do that, see the https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html#setup.asciidoc[devonfw-ide setup].\n\n==== Execution\n\nNow move to your project directory manually or by executing `cd /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient` in the terminal.\nNext, use the following command to build the java project.\n\n`mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`\n\nThe maven command 'clean' will clear the target directory beforehand. So your build will start from a clean state.\nInstall will then compile, test and package your Java project and copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.\n\nWe do not need to execute the test cases, so we can skip them by using the option '-Dmaven.test.skip=true'.\n\n\n* Once, application builds successfully. Open new terminal by clicking \"+\" and wait for it to load.\r\n* Now, Copy and execute below command to navigate into client server.\r\n  `cd devonfw/workspaces/main/httprestclient/server`\r\n* Now, Copy and execute below command to start the application.\r\n  `devon mvn spring-boot:run`\r\n\r\nTo test Synchronous method, follow below steps.\r\n* Click on \"+\" next to terminal tab\r\n* Select \"select port to view host\"\r\n* Enter the port number \"8080\" \r\n* In the url, append \"/httprestclient/services/rest/testrest/v1/response/\"\r\n* Enter username as \"admin\" and password as \"admin\"\r\n* You will be able to see response \"Welcome to REST API world\"\r\n\n\n\nYou have successfully created devon4j CXF REST Client.\r\nFor more details on devon4j follow https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc.html\r\n\n"

On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\r\nYou have successfully migrated the sample project from an older version to the latest version using command line!!\r\n\r\nFor more details on devon4j java commands for various functionalities and the arguments (devon java «args») follow \r\nhttps://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-usage.asciidoc.html#java.asciidoc\r\n\n",

Linux and macOS + \nOpen the Terminal in your current workspace and execute the command `bash cloneProject.sh` to run the script.\n\n\n\n== Overview\n \n\nAn Angular application is component based like [devon4j](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j), but different terminology is used as compared to devon4j. Primarily the term used is **module** instead of **component**.\nTo clarify this:\n\n* A **component** describes an UI element containing HTML, CSS and JavaScript - structure, design and logic encapsulated inside a reusable container called component.\n\n* A **module** describes an applications feature area. The application flight-app may have a module called booking.\n\nAn application developed using Angular consists of multiple modules. There are feature modules and special modules - *core* and *shared*. Angular or Angular Styleguide give no guidance on how to structure a module internally. This is where this architecture comes in.\n\nWe will refer a devon4ng application for better understanding. But before that, let us understand the Architectural Layers of a devon4ng application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Architectural Layers\n \n\nimage::images/architecture-layers.png[]\n\nThe architecture describes two layers:\n\n* [Components Layer](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#components-layer.asciidoc) encapsulates components which present the current application state. Components are separated into [Smart and Dumb Components](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#components-layer.asciidoc_smart-and-dumb-components). The only logic present is view logic inside Smart Components.\n\n* [Services Layer](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#services-layer.asciidoc) is more or less what we call &#39;business logic layer&#39; on the server side. The layer defines the applications state, the transitions between state and classic business logic. Stores contain application state over time to which Smart Components subscribe to. Adapters are used to perform XHRs, WebSocket connections, etc. The business model is described inside the module. Use case services perform business logic needed for use cases. A use case services interacts with the store and adapters. Methods of use case services are the API for Smart Components. Those methods are Actions in reactive terminology.\n\nLet us refer the application to understand the above concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=== Architectural Layers explained\n\n\n\nThe application you see here is a clone of devon4ng-application-template.

If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.\n\n== devonfw setup\n \n\nIf you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(npm ng vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n \n\n\n\n=== Run a setup script\n\n\n\nRun a Script to setup the enviroment for the Tutorial.  \n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any Editor that can edit files.\n\n==== Create the Setupscript\nOpen a editor and create a new file by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work.\n\n.Operating system\n. Windows + \nThe editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file where you should insert the following text.\n+\n[source, powershell]\n----\ncd devonfw/workspaces/main\ngit clone https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template.git\n----\nSave the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens where you should set the filename to *cloneProject.ps1* and save it to your current directory. \n\n. Linux and macOS + \nThe editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file where you can insert the following text.\n+\n[source, bash]\n----\ncd devonfw/workspaces/main\ngit clone https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template.git\n----\nSave the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens where you should set the filename to *cloneProject.sh* and save it to your current directory. \n\n==== Run the setup script\n\n.Operating system\n. Windows + \nOpen the PowerShell in your current workspace and execute the command `./cloneProject.ps1` to run the script.\n. Linux and macOS + \nOpen the Terminal in your current workspace and execute the command `bash cloneProject.sh` to run the script.\n\n\n\n== Overview\n \n\nAn Angular application is component based like [devon4j](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j), but different terminology is used as compared to devon4j. Primarily the term used is **module** instead of **component**.\nTo clarify this:\n\n* A **component** describes an UI element containing HTML, CSS and JavaScript - structure, design and logic encapsulated inside a reusable container called component.\n\n* A **module** describes an applications feature area. The application flight-app may have a module called booking.\n\nAn application developed using Angular consists of multiple modules. There are feature modules and special modules - *core* and *shared*. Angular or Angular Styleguide give no guidance on how to structure a module internally. This is where this architecture comes in.\n\nWe will refer a devon4ng application for better understanding. But before that, let us understand the Architectural Layers of a devon4ng application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Architectural Layers\n \n\nimage::images/architecture-layers.png[]\n\nThe architecture describes two layers:\n\n* [Components Layer](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#components-layer.asciidoc) encapsulates components which present the current application state. Components are separated into [Smart and Dumb Components](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#components-layer.asciidoc_smart-and-dumb-components). The only logic present is view logic inside Smart Components.\n\n* [Services Layer](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_layers.html#services-layer.asciidoc) is more or less what we call &#39;business logic layer&#39; on the server side. The layer defines the applications state, the transitions between state and classic business logic. Stores contain application state over time to which Smart Components subscribe to. Adapters are used to perform XHRs, WebSocket connections, etc. The business model is described inside the module. Use case services perform business logic needed for use cases. A use case services interacts with the store and adapters. Methods of use case services are the API for Smart Components. Those methods are Actions in reactive terminology.\n\nLet us refer the application to understand the above concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=== Architectural Layers explained\n\n\n\nThe application you see here is a clone of devon4ng-application-template. You can find it [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng-application-template)\n\nThe `SampleDataModule` is a nice example of the different layers explained. It holds some components (representing the *components* layer) and also has a `SampleDataService` (representing the *service* layer) which is imported in the required components.\n\nThe service acts as the adapter element explained earlier (used to make XHR calls). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Modules\n \n\nimage::images/architecture-modules.png[]\n\nEvery Angular application requires a module called app which is the main entrance to an application at runtime - this module gets bootstrapped. Angular Styleguide defines feature modules and two special modules - core and shared.\n\n* A **feature** module is basically a vertical cut through both layers.\n\n* The **shared** module consists of components shared across feature modules.\n\n* The **core** module holds services shared across modules.\n\nSo core module is a module only having a services layer and shared module is a module only having a components layer.\n\nThe `SampleDataModule` which we visitied earlier is a typical example of a **feature** module\n\nLet us refer the application again for examples on **core** module and **shared** module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Core module\n \n\nIn the `CoreModule`, you can see services like `TranslocoRootModule` (translation service), `HttpRequestInterceptorService` (HTTP interceptor sesrvice) and Angular Material related modules being part of this core module. This core module is then imported into every other module as the services are used throughout the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Shared module\n \n\nIn the `LayoutModule`, you can see components like `NavBar` and `Header` being part of this module. This module is comparable to a **shared** module which holds common components used throughout the application. The shared module is imported into other (feature) modules where the common components will be used.\n\nYou can study in more detail about Angular architecture by following [this document](https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/master-devon4ng.asciidoc_architecture.html#meta-architecture.asciidoc_devonfw-reference-client-architecture).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, in this tutorial you learned \n\n* the concepts of modules and components\n\n* the layers of the architecture - components and services\n\n* the different types of modules - core, shared and feature\n\nThen we referred a devon4ng application by cloning it and traversing through its files.

You have to navigate to first.module.ts and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app/first` and select the file `first.module.ts`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner first.module.ts will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\n\nimport { FirstRoutingModule } from './first-routing.module';\nimport { FirstComponent } from './first/first.component';\n\nimport { SecondLeftModule } from './second-left/second-left.module';\nimport { SecondRightModule } from './second-right/second-right.module';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [FirstComponent],\n  imports: [\n    CommonModule,\n    FirstRoutingModule,\n    SecondLeftModule,\n    SecondRightModule,\n  ]\n})\nexport class FirstModule { }\n\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened first.module.ts. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and first.module.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Eager loading vs Lazy Loading \n=== Changing of the app-routing.module.ts file\nIf you run the project at this point you can see in the terminal that just the main file is built.\n![compile-eager](./assets/compile-eager.png)\n\nGo to port 4200 and check the Network tab in the Developer Tools. We can see a document named \"first\" is loaded. If you click on [Go to right module] a second level module opens, but there is no 'second-right' document.\n![second-lvl-right-eager](./assets/second-lvl-right-eager.png)\n\nNow we will modify the app to lazily load the modules. Modifying an angular application to load its modules lazily is easy, you have to change the routing configuration of the desired module (for example `FirstModule`). Instead of loading a component, you dynamically import it in a `loadChildren` attribute because modules acts as gates to access components \"inside\" them. Updating this app to load lazily has four consecuences: no component attribute, no import of `FirstComponent`, `FirstModule` import has to be removed from the imports array at `app.module.ts`, and change of context.\n\nAlso, in `first-routing.module.ts` you can change the path for the `ContentComponent`s from `first/second-left` and `first/second-right` to simply `second-left` and `second-right` respectively,  because it aquires the context set by AppRoutingModule.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of app-routing.module.ts in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file app-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens.

Also, if you check the Network tab in the developer tools, you could see the (lazy) modules getting loaded when needed. Since, `FirstModule` is the first path we visit, it is getting loaded at first only.\n![compile-first-lazy](./assets/compile-first-lazy.png)\n![first-lvl-lazy](./assets/first-lvl-lazy.png)\n\nNow, lets make the SecondLeftModule load lazily. For this, you need to change `component` to `loadChildren` and refer `SecondLeftModule` in the file `first-routing.module.ts`. Next, you need to remove `SecondLeftModule` from the `imports` array of `first.module.ts`. After that you need to route the `ContentComponent` within the `second-left-routing.module.ts`.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of first-routing.module.ts in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file first-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens.

            "wiki_vscode": "= Boost Angular’s Performance by Lazy Loading your Modules with devon4ng\n\n== Learn how to defer initialization of modules in Angular until it is needed \n\nIn single-page-applications as the application size increases its loading speed decreases (since typically the entire application is loaded at once). Lazy loading is a design pattern that defers initialization of objects until it is needed. Angular handles lazy loading through the routing module which redirects to requested pages. Those pages can be loaded at start or on demand. In this tutorial you will build a simple app to understand how lazyloading is implemented in Angular.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Basic Angular knowledge\n\n## Learning goals\nIn this tutorial you will learn how to:\n\n* create an Angular application using the devon command\n\n* look how all modules are loaded by an application at the begining (eager loading)\n\n* implement lazy loading and understand its concept and advantages\n\n\n\nThe definition of each step of this tutorial can be found at https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/tree/main/devon4ng-lazy-loading/. \n\nFeel free to report any errors to us or fix them yourself.

On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(npm ng vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n \n\n\n\n== Enable routing with router-outlet \n=== Changing of the app.component.html file\nIn the file app.component.html delete all the content and put in the `router-outlet` tag.\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app.component.html in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.component.html will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Create the modules and their components \n=== Create the first-routing.module.ts file\nNext you will create the feature modules and components for the app. You will follow the structure shown in the image in the first step. You can use the CLI command `devon ng generate module` along with the `--routing` flag to generate the modules, and `devon ng generate component` command to generate the components.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Creating first-routing.module.ts in the VS Code Editor\n\nCreate first-routing.module.ts in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it. \n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n. A new VS Code editor window will be opened with an untitled-1 filename.\n \nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\n\nconst routes: Routes = [];\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],\n  exports: [RouterModule]\n})\nexport class FirstRoutingModule { }\n\n---- \nNow insert the copied text into the new file.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app/first/first-routing.module.ts*. \nSelect the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app/first`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `first-routing.module.ts` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and first-routing.module.ts has been created and filled with some content.\n\n\n\n=== Create the first.module.ts file\n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file.

You have to navigate to first.module.ts and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app/first` and select the file `first.module.ts`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and first.module.ts will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\n\nimport { FirstRoutingModule } from './first-routing.module';\nimport { FirstComponent } from './first/first.component';\n\nimport { SecondLeftModule } from './second-left/second-left.module';\nimport { SecondRightModule } from './second-right/second-right.module';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [FirstComponent],\n  imports: [\n    CommonModule,\n    FirstRoutingModule,\n    SecondLeftModule,\n    SecondRightModule,\n  ]\n})\nexport class FirstModule { }\n\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened first.module.ts. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and first.module.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Eager loading vs Lazy Loading \n=== Changing of the app-routing.module.ts file\nIf you run the project at this point you can see in the terminal that just the main file is built.\n![compile-eager](./assets/compile-eager.png)\n\nGo to port 4200 and check the Network tab in the Developer Tools. We can see a document named \"first\" is loaded. If you click on [Go to right module] a second level module opens, but there is no 'second-right' document.\n![second-lvl-right-eager](./assets/second-lvl-right-eager.png)\n\nNow we will modify the app to lazily load the modules. Modifying an angular application to load its modules lazily is easy, you have to change the routing configuration of the desired module (for example `FirstModule`). Instead of loading a component, you dynamically import it in a `loadChildren` attribute because modules acts as gates to access components \"inside\" them. Updating this app to load lazily has four consecuences: no component attribute, no import of `FirstComponent`, `FirstModule` import has to be removed from the imports array at `app.module.ts`, and change of context.\n\nAlso, in `first-routing.module.ts` you can change the path for the `ContentComponent`s from `first/second-left` and `first/second-right` to simply `second-left` and `second-right` respectively,  because it aquires the context set by AppRoutingModule.\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app-routing.module.ts in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app-routing.module.ts and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app` and select the file `app-routing.module.ts`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app-routing.module.ts will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\n\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: 'first',\n    loadChildren: () => import('./first/first.module').then(m => m.FirstModule),\n  },\n  {\n    path: '',\n    redirectTo: 'first',\n    pathMatch: 'full',\n  },\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],\n  exports: [RouterModule]\n})\nexport class AppRoutingModule { }\n\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app-routing.module.ts. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app-routing.module.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n=== Changing of the app.module.ts file\n\n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app.module.ts in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.module.ts and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app` and select the file `app.module.ts`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.module.ts will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    AppRoutingModule,\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.module.ts. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.module.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n=== Changing of the first-routing.module.ts file\n\n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of first-routing.module.ts in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file first-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to first-routing.module.ts and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app/first` and select the file `first-routing.module.ts`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and first-routing.module.ts will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\nimport { ContentComponent as ContentLeft} from './second-left/content/content.component';\nimport { ContentComponent as ContentRight} from './second-right/content/content.component';\nimport { FirstComponent } from './first/first.component';\n\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: '',\n    component: FirstComponent\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'second-left',\n    component: ContentLeft\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'second-right',\n    component: ContentRight\n  }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],\n  exports: [RouterModule]\n})\nexport class FirstRoutingModule { }\n\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened first-routing.module.ts. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and first-routing.module.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Lazily load the second left module \n=== Changing of the first-routing.module.ts file\nNow when you check the terminal running the app, you could see the lazy loaded modules getting generated along with the main bundle. Also, if you check the Network tab in the developer tools, you could see the (lazy) modules getting loaded when needed. Since, `FirstModule` is the first path we visit, it is getting loaded at first only.\n![compile-first-lazy](./assets/compile-first-lazy.png)\n![first-lvl-lazy](./assets/first-lvl-lazy.png)\n\nNow, lets make the SecondLeftModule load lazily. For this, you need to change `component` to `loadChildren` and refer `SecondLeftModule` in the file `first-routing.module.ts`. Next, you need to remove `SecondLeftModule` from the `imports` array of `first.module.ts`. After that you need to route the `ContentComponent` within the `second-left-routing.module.ts`.\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of first-routing.module.ts in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file first-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to first-routing.module.ts and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/level-app/src/app/first` and select the file `first-routing.module.ts`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and first-routing.module.ts will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\nimport { ContentComponent as ContentLeft} from './second-left/content/content.component';\nimport { ContentComponent as ContentRight} from './second-right/content/content.component';\nimport { FirstComponent } from './first/first.component';\n\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: '',\n    component: FirstComponent\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'second-left',\n    loadChildren: () => import('./second-left/second-left.module').then(m => m.SecondLeftModule),\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'second-right',\n    component: ContentRight\n  }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)],\n  exports: [RouterModule]\n})\nexport class FirstRoutingModule { }\n\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened first-routing.module.ts. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and first-routing.module.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n=== Changing of the first.module.ts file\n\n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of first.module.ts in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file first.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens.

On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(npm ng vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n \n\n\n\n== Add Angular Material \n=== Installation of package @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations\nNext you will add Angular Material to your application.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* Install Node.js. You can download Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/[here].\n* Installed npm. You can download npm https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm[here] and follow the installation instructions.\n\n==== Execution\n\nYou can install the package @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations and add it to the dependencies.\n\nNow execute `npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations` in the terminal.\n\n\nThis may take some time.\n\n\n\n== Import Material components \n=== Changing of the app.module.ts file\nOnce the dependencies are installed, you need to import the BrowserAnimationsModule in your AppModule for animations support.\nAlso, Angular Material provides a host of components for designing your application. All the components are well structured into NgModules. For each component from the Angular Material library that you want to use, you have to import the respective NgModule.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of app.module.ts in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file app.module.ts, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.module.ts and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.module.ts`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app.module.ts will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\nimport { MatIconModule } from '@angular/material/icon';\nimport { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';\nimport { MatMenuModule } from '@angular/material/menu';\nimport { MatListModule } from '@angular/material/list';\nimport { MatToolbarModule } from '@angular/material/toolbar';\nimport { MatSidenavModule } from '@angular/material/sidenav';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\n    MatIconModule,\n    MatButtonModule,\n    MatMenuModule,\n    MatListModule,\n    MatToolbarModule,\n    MatSidenavModule,\n    AppRoutingModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.module.ts. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.module.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Load Material icons \n=== Changing of the index.html file\nTo use Material Design Icons along with the mat-icon component, you will load the Material Icons library in your `src/index.html` file.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of index.html in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file index.html, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.html and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src` and select the file `index.html`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner index.html will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, html]\n----\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <title>Devon4ngMatLayout</title>\n  <base href=\"/\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n  <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n  <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"favicon.ico\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <app-root></app-root>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened index.html. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.html has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Add global styles \n=== Changing of the styles.scss file\nNow that you have all the Angular Material related dependencies set up in your project, you can start coding. Let’s begin by adding a suitable `margin` and `font` to the body element of your single page application. You will add it in the `src/styles.scss` file to apply it globally.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of styles.scss in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file styles.scss, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to styles.scss and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src` and select the file `styles.scss`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner styles.scss will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, css]\n----\n@import \"~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\";\n\nbody {\n    margin: 0;\n    font-family: \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, sans-serif;\n  }\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened styles.scss. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and styles.scss has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Add a header \n=== Changing of the app.component.html file\nClear the `app.component.html` file and setup a header with a menu button and some navigational links. You will use `mat-toolbar`, `mat-button`, `mat-menu`, `mat-icon` and `mat-icon-button` for this:\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of app.component.html in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app.component.html will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<mat-toolbar color=\"primary\">\n  <button mat-icon-button aria-label=\"menu\" class=\"menu\">\n    <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>\n  </button>\n  <button mat-button [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu\">Menu 1</button>\n  <button mat-button>Menu 2</button>\n  <button mat-button>Menu 3</button>\n\n  <mat-menu #submenu=\"matMenu\">\n    <button mat-menu-item>Sub-menu 1</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu2\">Sub-menu 2</button>\n  </mat-menu>\n\n  <mat-menu #submenu2=\"matMenu\">\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 1</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 2</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 3</button>\n  </mat-menu>\n\n</mat-toolbar>\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.\n\nThe color attribute on the mat-toolbar element will give it the primary (indigo) color as defined by your theme. The color attribute works with most Angular Material components; the possible values are `primary`, `accent` and `warn`. The `mat-toolbar` is a suitable component to represent a header. It serves as a placeholder for elements you want in your header. Inside the `mat-toolbar`, you start with a button having `mat-icon-button` attribute, which itself contains a `mat-icon` element having the value `menu`. This will serve as a menu button which you can use to toggle the `sidenav`. You follow it with some sample buttons having the `mat-button` attribute. Notice the first button has a property `matMenuTriggerFor` binded to a local reference submenu. As the property name suggests, the click of this button will display the mat-menu element with the specified local reference as a drop-down menu. The rest of the code is self explanatory.\n\n\n== Shift header menu buttons to right \n=== Changing of the app.component.scss file\nYou want to keep the sidenav toggling menu button on the left and move the rest to the right to make it look better. To do this add the following style to the `menu` class in `app.component.scss`:\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of app.component.scss in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file app.component.scss, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.scss and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.scss`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app.component.scss will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n.menu {\n    margin-right: auto;\n}\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.component.scss. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.scss has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Create navigatable pages \n=== Create the home.component.html file\nNext, you will create a sidenav. But before that lets create a couple of components to navigate between, the links of which you will add to the sidenav. You can use the `ng generate component` (or `ng g c` command for short) to create Home and Data components. But here, you will create them manually. You nest them in the `pages` sub-directory since they represent your pages. And you will also add the new components to your AppModule.\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* Any Editor that can edit files\n\n==== Creating home.component.html in any Editor\n\nCreate home.component.html in any Editor and insert the following data into it. .\n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner of the editor and select *New* or *New File* or mostly also the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n will also work.\nThe editor opens a new editor window for an untitled file that can be edited now.\n \nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<h2>Home Page</h2>\n\n---- \nNow insert the copied text into the new file.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app/pages/home/home.component.html*. \nSelect the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app/pages/home`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `home.component.html` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and home.component.html has been created and filled with some data.\n\n\n=== Create the home.component.scss file\n\n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file.

You had opted for routing while creating the application, so you have the routing module `app-routing.module.ts` setup for us. In this file, you have the empty routes array where you set up your routes:\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of app-routing.module.ts in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file app-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app-routing.module.ts and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app-routing.module.ts`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner app-routing.module.ts will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\nimport { HomeComponent } from './pages/home/home.component';\nimport { DataComponent } from './pages/data/data.component';\n\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },\n  { path: 'data', component: DataComponent }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],\n  exports: [RouterModule]\n})\nexport class AppRoutingModule { }\n\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app-routing.module.ts. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app-routing.module.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Changing of the app.component.html file\nYou need to provide a hook where the components will be loaded when their respective URLs are loaded. You do that by using the `router-outlet` directive in the `app.component.html`:\n \n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of app.component.html in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens.

To implement the sidenav you need to use 3 Angular Material components: `mat-sidenav-container`, `mat-sidenav` and `mat-sidenav-content`. The `mat-sidenav-container`, as the name suggests, acts as a container for the `sidenav` and the associated content. So it is the parent element, and `mat-sidenav` and `mat-sidenav-content` are the children sibling elements. `mat-sidenav` represents the sidenav. You can put any content you want, though it is usually used to conatain a list of navigational links. The `mat-sidenav-content` element is for conataining your main page content. Since you need the `sidenav` application-wide, you will put it in the `app.component.html`\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of app.component.html in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens.

On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(npm ng vscode)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n \n\n\n\n== Add Angular Material \n=== Installation of package @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations\nNext you will add Angular Material to your application.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* Install Node.js. You can download Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/[here].\n* Installed npm. You can download npm https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm[here] and follow the installation instructions.\n\n==== Execution\n\nYou can install the package @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations and add it to the dependencies.\n\nNow execute `npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations` in the terminal.\n\n\nThis may take some time.\n\n\n\n== Import Material components \n=== Changing of the app.module.ts file\nOnce the dependencies are installed, you need to import the BrowserAnimationsModule in your AppModule for animations support.\nAlso, Angular Material provides a host of components for designing your application. All the components are well structured into NgModules. For each component from the Angular Material library that you want to use, you have to import the respective NgModule.\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app.module.ts in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.module.ts and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.module.ts`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.module.ts will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\nimport { MatIconModule } from '@angular/material/icon';\nimport { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';\nimport { MatMenuModule } from '@angular/material/menu';\nimport { MatListModule } from '@angular/material/list';\nimport { MatToolbarModule } from '@angular/material/toolbar';\nimport { MatSidenavModule } from '@angular/material/sidenav';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\n    MatIconModule,\n    MatButtonModule,\n    MatMenuModule,\n    MatListModule,\n    MatToolbarModule,\n    MatSidenavModule,\n    AppRoutingModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.module.ts. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.module.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Load Material icons \n=== Changing of the index.html file\nTo use Material Design Icons along with the mat-icon component, you will load the Material Icons library in your `src/index.html` file.\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of index.html in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file index.html, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to index.html and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src` and select the file `index.html`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and index.html will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, html]\n----\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <title>Devon4ngMatLayout</title>\n  <base href=\"/\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n  <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n  <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/x-icon\" href=\"favicon.ico\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <app-root></app-root>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened index.html. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and index.html has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Add global styles \n=== Changing of the styles.scss file\nNow that you have all the Angular Material related dependencies set up in your project, you can start coding. Let’s begin by adding a suitable `margin` and `font` to the body element of your single page application. You will add it in the `src/styles.scss` file to apply it globally.\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of styles.scss in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file styles.scss, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to styles.scss and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src` and select the file `styles.scss`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and styles.scss will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, css]\n----\n@import \"~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\";\n\nbody {\n    margin: 0;\n    font-family: \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, sans-serif;\n  }\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened styles.scss. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and styles.scss has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Add a header \n=== Changing of the app.component.html file\nClear the `app.component.html` file and setup a header with a menu button and some navigational links. You will use `mat-toolbar`, `mat-button`, `mat-menu`, `mat-icon` and `mat-icon-button` for this:\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app.component.html in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.component.html will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<mat-toolbar color=\"primary\">\n  <button mat-icon-button aria-label=\"menu\" class=\"menu\">\n    <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>\n  </button>\n  <button mat-button [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu\">Menu 1</button>\n  <button mat-button>Menu 2</button>\n  <button mat-button>Menu 3</button>\n\n  <mat-menu #submenu=\"matMenu\">\n    <button mat-menu-item>Sub-menu 1</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu2\">Sub-menu 2</button>\n  </mat-menu>\n\n  <mat-menu #submenu2=\"matMenu\">\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 1</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 2</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 3</button>\n  </mat-menu>\n\n</mat-toolbar>\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.\n\nThe color attribute on the mat-toolbar element will give it the primary (indigo) color as defined by your theme. The color attribute works with most Angular Material components; the possible values are `primary`, `accent` and `warn`. The `mat-toolbar` is a suitable component to represent a header. It serves as a placeholder for elements you want in your header. Inside the `mat-toolbar`, you start with a button having `mat-icon-button` attribute, which itself contains a `mat-icon` element having the value `menu`. This will serve as a menu button which you can use to toggle the `sidenav`. You follow it with some sample buttons having the `mat-button` attribute. Notice the first button has a property `matMenuTriggerFor` binded to a local reference submenu. As the property name suggests, the click of this button will display the mat-menu element with the specified local reference as a drop-down menu. The rest of the code is self explanatory.\n\n\n== Shift header menu buttons to right \n=== Changing of the app.component.scss file\nYou want to keep the sidenav toggling menu button on the left and move the rest to the right to make it look better. To do this add the following style to the `menu` class in `app.component.scss`:\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app.component.scss in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app.component.scss, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.scss and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.scss`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.component.scss will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n.menu {\n    margin-right: auto;\n}\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.component.scss. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.scss has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Create navigatable pages \n=== Create the home.component.html file\nNext, you will create a sidenav. But before that lets create a couple of components to navigate between, the links of which you will add to the sidenav. You can use the `ng generate component` (or `ng g c` command for short) to create Home and Data components. But here, you will create them manually. You nest them in the `pages` sub-directory since they represent your pages. And you will also add the new components to your AppModule.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Creating home.component.html in the VS Code Editor\n\nCreate home.component.html in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it. \n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n. A new VS Code editor window will be opened with an untitled-1 filename.\n \nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<h2>Home Page</h2>\n\n---- \nNow insert the copied text into the new file.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app/pages/home/home.component.html*. \nSelect the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app/pages/home`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `home.component.html` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and home.component.html has been created and filled with some content.\n\n\n\n=== Create the home.component.scss file\n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Creating home.component.scss in the VS Code Editor\n\nCreate home.component.scss in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it. \n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n. A new VS Code editor window will be opened with an untitled-1 filename.\n \nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nh2 {\n    text-align: center;\n    margin-top: 50px;\n}\n---- \nNow insert the copied text into the new file.\n\nThe next step is to save the file by selecting *Save* or *Save as* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s.\nA file explorer window opens.\nYou should check if you are currently in the right directory where you want to save *devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app/pages/home/home.component.scss*. \nSelect the directory `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app/pages/home`. If the directory does not exist, create the missing folders or run through the previous steps from the wiki again.\nTo save the file specify the name of the file. Paste `home.component.scss` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and home.component.scss has been created and filled with some content.\n\n\n\n=== Create the home.component.ts file\n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Existing folder you want to create the file. (If the folder doesn't exist you can create it from with the editor).\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Creating home.component.ts in the VS Code Editor\n\nCreate home.component.ts in the VS Code editor and insert the following data into it. \n\nOpening a new file can be done by going to the file context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol and selecting *New File* or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+n.

Paste `data.component.ts` in the text field *File name:*. \nThe last step is to save the file with the *Save* button in the bottom right corner and data.component.ts has been created and filled with some content.\n\n\n\n=== Changing of the app.module.ts file\n\n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app.module.ts in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.module.ts and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.module.ts`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.module.ts will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';\nimport { MatIconModule } from '@angular/material/icon';\nimport { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';\nimport { MatMenuModule } from '@angular/material/menu';\nimport { MatListModule } from '@angular/material/list';\nimport { MatToolbarModule } from '@angular/material/toolbar';\nimport { MatSidenavModule } from '@angular/material/sidenav';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { HomeComponent } from './pages/home/home.component';\nimport { DataComponent } from './pages/data/data.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent,\n    HomeComponent,\n    DataComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserAnimationsModule,\n    MatIconModule,\n    MatButtonModule,\n    MatMenuModule,\n    MatListModule,\n    MatToolbarModule,\n    MatSidenavModule,\n    AppRoutingModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.module.ts. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.module.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Add routing \n=== Changing of the app-routing.module.ts file\nLet us set up the routing such that when you visit the root url you see the `HomeComponent` and when you visit `/data` url you see the `DataComponent`. You had opted for routing while creating the application, so you have the routing module `app-routing.module.ts` setup for us. In this file, you have the empty routes array where you set up your routes:\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app-routing.module.ts in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app-routing.module.ts, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app-routing.module.ts and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app-routing.module.ts`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app-routing.module.ts will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';\nimport { HomeComponent } from './pages/home/home.component';\nimport { DataComponent } from './pages/data/data.component';\n\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },\n  { path: 'data', component: DataComponent }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],\n  exports: [RouterModule]\n})\nexport class AppRoutingModule { }\n\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app-routing.module.ts. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app-routing.module.ts has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Changing of the app.component.html file\nYou need to provide a hook where the components will be loaded when their respective URLs are loaded. You do that by using the `router-outlet` directive in the `app.component.html`:\n \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app.component.html in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.component.html will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<mat-toolbar color=\"primary\">\n  <button mat-icon-button aria-label=\"menu\" class=\"menu\">\n    <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>\n  </button>\n  <button mat-button [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu\">Menu 1</button>\n  <button mat-button>Menu 2</button>\n  <button mat-button>Menu 3</button>\n\n  <mat-menu #submenu=\"matMenu\">\n    <button mat-menu-item>Sub-menu 1</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu2\">Sub-menu 2</button>\n  </mat-menu>\n\n  <mat-menu #submenu2=\"matMenu\">\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 1</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 2</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 3</button>\n  </mat-menu>\n\n</mat-toolbar>\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Create the sidenav \n=== Changing of the app.component.html file\nLet us finally create the sidenav. To implement the sidenav you need to use 3 Angular Material components: `mat-sidenav-container`, `mat-sidenav` and `mat-sidenav-content`. The `mat-sidenav-container`, as the name suggests, acts as a container for the `sidenav` and the associated content. So it is the parent element, and `mat-sidenav` and `mat-sidenav-content` are the children sibling elements. `mat-sidenav` represents the sidenav. You can put any content you want, though it is usually used to conatain a list of navigational links. The `mat-sidenav-content` element is for conataining your main page content. Since you need the `sidenav` application-wide, you will put it in the `app.component.html`\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app.component.html in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.html and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.html`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.component.html will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<mat-toolbar color=\"primary\">\n  <button mat-icon-button aria-label=\"menu\" class=\"menu\" (click)=\"sidenav.toggle()\">\n    <mat-icon>menu</mat-icon>\n  </button>\n  <button mat-button [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu\">Menu 1</button>\n  <button mat-button>Menu 2</button>\n  <button mat-button>Menu 3</button>\n\n  <mat-menu #submenu=\"matMenu\">\n    <button mat-menu-item>Sub-menu 1</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item [matMenuTriggerFor]=\"submenu2\">Sub-menu 2</button>\n  </mat-menu>\n\n  <mat-menu #submenu2=\"matMenu\">\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 1</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 2</button>\n    <button mat-menu-item>Menu Item 3</button>\n  </mat-menu>\n\n</mat-toolbar>\n<mat-sidenav-container>\n  <mat-sidenav mode=\"over\" [disableClose]=\"false\" #sidenav>\n    Sidenav\n  </mat-sidenav>\n  <mat-sidenav-content>\n    <router-outlet></router-outlet>\n  </mat-sidenav-content>\n</mat-sidenav-container>\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.component.html. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.html has been changed.\n\n\n\n=== Changing of the app.component.scss file\n\n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app.component.scss in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app.component.scss, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to app.component.scss and select it. Choose the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4ng-mat-layout/src/app` and select the file `app.component.scss`. \nYou can confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner and app.component.scss will be opened in a new VS Code editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n.menu {\n    margin-right: auto;\n}\nmat-sidenav-container {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 64px;\n    left: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    bottom: 0;\n}\n----\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened app.component.scss. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and app.component.scss has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Style the sidenav \n=== Changing of the app.component.html file\nThe sidenav’s width will be corrected when you add the navigational links to it. That is the only thing remaining to be done. Lets implement it now:\n  \n\n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* VS Code Editor (can be installed in your devonfw environment).\n\n==== Changing of app.component.html in the VS Code Editor\n\nTo change the file app.component.html, you have to open it in VS Code first. \nOpen VS Code and choose in the *File* context menu in the top left corner right next to the VS Code symbol *Open File...* or just use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens.

If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.\n\n== devonfw setup\nFollow the below steps to setup your devonfw development environment.\n \n\nIf you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n\nThe installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.\n \n\ndevonfw-ide is installed successfully with Maven and Java too. These tools can be customized by changing the configuration\nin devon.properties.\n\nMore information on devonfw-ide can be found at https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devonfw-ide-introduction.asciidoc.html\n\n\n",

It contains several sample applications for many extensions to Quarkus. For this tutorial, we will use an application with a simple REST service contained in the `rest-json-quickstart` subfolder.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.\n\n==== Download\nOpen a terminal in your current workspace.\n\nFirstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to.\nIf the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal.\nIn this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.\n\nAfter that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.\n\nTo clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts.git` in the terminal.\n\n\n\n== Add the ServicedocGen maven plugin \n=== Changing of the pom.xml file\nNext step is to add the ServicedocGen plugin to the project's pom.xml \n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of pom.xml in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file pom.xml, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to pom.xml and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/quarkus-quickstarts/rest-json-quickstart` and select the file `pom.xml`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner pom.xml will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<project

insert the copied text into the opened pom.xml. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and pom.xml has been changed.\n\nTake a look at the `configuration` section of the plugin. In this section you can configure the behavior of the plugin. Not all options are necessary, such as the `info` section. This one is only used to add additional information to the OpenAPI file.\n\nSome other parts are necessary. The `classnameRegex` parameter is used to configure which name pattern the REST service classes must match.\n\nThe `templates` section is used to configure what is created by the plugin. In this case, the OpenAPI specification is created in yaml format and the Swagger UI file is also created.\n\n\n",

If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.\n\n== devonfw setup\n \n\nIf you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n\nThe installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.\n \n\n\n\n== Clone quarkus-quickstarts repository \n=== Clone Repository\nFirst, clone the `quarkus-quickstarts` repository from GitHub. It contains several sample applications for many extensions to Quarkus. For this tutorial, we will use an application with a simple REST service contained in the `rest-json-quickstart` subfolder.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.\n\n==== Download\nOpen a terminal in your current workspace.\n\nFirstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to.\nIf the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal.\nIn this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.\n\nAfter that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.\n\nTo clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts.git` in the terminal.\n\n\n\n== Add the ServicedocGen maven plugin \n=== Changing of the pom.xml file\nNext step is to add the ServicedocGen plugin to the project's pom.xml \n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of pom.xml in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file pom.xml, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to pom.xml and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/quarkus-quickstarts/rest-json-quickstart` and select the file `pom.xml`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner pom.xml will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<project

insert the copied text into the opened pom.xml. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and pom.xml has been changed.\n\nTake a look at the `configuration` section of the plugin. In this section you can configure the behavior of the plugin. Not all options are necessary, such as the `info` section. This one is only used to add additional information to the OpenAPI file.\n\nSome other parts are necessary. The `classnameRegex` parameter is used to configure which name pattern the REST service classes must match.\n\nThe `templates` section is used to configure what is created by the plugin. In this case, the OpenAPI specification is created in yaml format and the Swagger UI file is also created.\n\n\n"

            "wiki_vscode": "= OpenAPI and Swagger UI generation with Quarkus Smallrye extension\n\n\n\nThis tutorial will show you how to include the Quarkus Smallrye OpenAPI extension in Quarkus projects to automatically generate OpenAPI specifications and Swagger UI from your REST APIs.\nFor more information about OpenAPI and the Smallrye OpenAPI extension, see the [devon4j documentation](https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/blob/master/documentation/guide-openapi.asciidoc) or the [official Quarkus guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/openapi-swaggerui).\n\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Installed devonfw-ide (or at least Java and Maven installed)\n\n\n### Learning goals\n\n* You will learn how to generate OpenAPI specifications and Swagger UI from REST services\n\n\n\n\nThe definition of each step of this tutorial can be found at https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/tree/main/openapi-generation-smallrye/. \n\nFeel free to report any errors to us or fix them yourself. Errors can be reported by creating an issue in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/issues[tutorials repository]. To fix the error fork the repository and create a pull request. Errors in the wiki can be reported and fixed in the https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorial-compiler[Tutorial-compiler repository].\nYou can find a description of what to look for when creating a pull request at the devonfw contribution guide: https://devonfw.com/website/pages/community/community.html#community.asciidoc_contributing-to-devonfw. If you want to create a tutorial you can start with the https://katacoda.com/devonfw/scenarios/create-your-own-tutorial[katacoda tutorial] and read the description for creating your own tutorials: https://github.com/devonfw-tutorials/tutorials/wiki/Development.\n\n== devonfw setup\n \n\nIf you already installed the devonfw IDE, you can skip this step.\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n* You need to have a tool to extract `.tar.gz` files. On Windows lower Windows 10 use can use https://www.7-zip.org/7-zip[7-Zip]. The most other platforms support this feature by default.\n* You need to have https://git-scm.com/[Git] and https://curl.se/[Curl] installed. On Windows you have to install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for Windows]. On Linux systems you might need to install the following tools in case they are not present (`sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)\n\nCreate a new directory in the location where you want to install the devonfw IDE. If you are using the terminal, navigate to this location and run `mkdir devonfw` and `cd devonfw` to create the directory and navigate into it.\n\n==== Download\n\n\n\nNow you have to download the latest release of the devonfw IDE. You can download it from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here].\n\nIn the Terminal execute `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz'` if you are using Windows.\n\nOn Linux use `wget -c 'https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz' -O devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz -`.\n\nOn MacOS, depending on your setup, you can either use the same `wget` command specified for the Linux installation (install wget via homebrew `brew install wget`) or use any other available download command i.e. `curl -o devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz`.\n\n\n\nAfter that you need to extract the downloaded file. To do this, run `tar -xvzf devonfw-ide-scripts.tar.gz`. Or you can simply use a tool (e.g. 7-Zip) for this.\n\n==== Setup\n\nFirst, you need to prepare a settings repository to specify the tools to be installed within the devonfw IDE. Normally this is done by your project. If you just want to test the devonfw IDE, you can use the default URL, which is https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings.\n\nFor now clone the repository on https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings or your own fork of it.\nFor this tutorial you have to write `DEVON_IDE_TOOLS=(java mvn)` into the devon.properties file of the cloned settings repository. These settings will now be passed into the installation process of the devonfw-ide.\nStart the setup process by executing `.\\setup 'path/to/settings'` (Windows) or `bash setup path/to/settings.git` (Linux).\n\nYou can also just execute `.\\setup` (Windows) or `bash setup` (Linux) and press Enter when the setup assistent asks for the URL to the settings repository. This will also download the default settings and install the default tools within the devonfw IDE.\n\n\nThe installer will also ask you if you want to enter secrets for your maven repository. You can simply skip this by pressing 'Enter'.\n \n\n\n\n== Clone quarkus-quickstarts repository \n=== Clone Repository\nFirst, clone the `quarkus-quickstarts` repository from GitHub. It contains several sample applications for many extensions to Quarkus. We will use a simple REST service for this tutorial and customize the application accordingly.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* You need to have Git installed. You can download Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[here] for your OS and install it by following the instructions.\n\n==== Download\nOpen a terminal in your current workspace.\n\nFirstly, you have to move to the directory where the repository should be cloned to.\nIf the directory does not exist yet, you can create it by using the `mkdir` command in the terminal.\nIn this case execute `mkdir -p /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main`.\n\nAfter that, move to the target directory by executing `cd  /home/runner/work/wiki-tutorials/wiki-tutorials/compiler/build/working/devonfw/workspaces/main` in the terminal.\n\nTo clone a Git repository execute `git clone https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts.git` in the terminal.\n\n\n\n== Add the extension \n=== Changing of the pom.xml file\nThe next step is to add the Smallrye OpenAPI extension to the project. Open the `pom.xml` file of project in the folder `rest-json-quickstart`. Add the extension `quarkus-smallrye-openapi` to the list of dependencies.\n  \n\n\n==== Prerequisites\n* Any editor that can edit files\n\n==== Changing of pom.xml in any Editor\n\n\nTo change the file pom.xml, you have to open it in any editor. \nOpen the editor and choose in the file context menu in the top left corner *Open ...* mostly also keyboard shortcut ctrl+o works. \nBased on your operating system a window with the file explorer opens. You have to navigate to pom.xml and select it.  Select the right folder manually by selecting the folders from the path `devonfw/workspaces/main/quarkus-quickstarts/rest-json-quickstart` and select the file `pom.xml`. \nYou confirm this with the *Open* button in the bottom right corner pom.xml will be opened in a new editor window.\n\nCopy the following text.\n[source, ]\n----\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<project xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\" \n  xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" \n  xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n  <groupId>org.acme</groupId>\n  <artifactId>rest-json-quickstart</artifactId>\n  <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n  <properties>\n    <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>\n    <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus</quarkus.platform.group-id>\n    <quarkus.platform.version>2.5.1.Final</quarkus.platform.version>\n    <surefire-plugin.version>3.0.0-M5</surefire-plugin.version>\n    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>\n    <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>\n    <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>\n  </properties>\n\n  <dependencyManagement>\n    <dependencies>\n      <dependency>\n        <groupId>${quarkus.platform.group-id}</groupId>\n        <artifactId>${quarkus.platform.artifact-id}</artifactId>\n        <version>${quarkus.platform.version}</version>\n        <type>pom</type>\n        <scope>import</scope>\n      </dependency>\n    </dependencies>\n  </dependencyManagement>\n\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n      <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy-jackson</artifactId>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n      <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-openapi</artifactId>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n      <artifactId>quarkus-junit5</artifactId>\n      <scope>test</scope>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>\n      <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>\n      <scope>test</scope>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n  <build>\n    <plugins>\n      <plugin>\n        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>\n        <version>${surefire-plugin.version}</version>\n        <configuration>\n          <systemPropertyVariables>\n            <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>\n            <maven.home>${maven.home}</maven.home>\n          </systemPropertyVariables>\n        </configuration>\n      </plugin>\n      <plugin>\n        <groupId>${quarkus.platform.group-id}</groupId>\n        <artifactId>quarkus-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n        <version>${quarkus.platform.version}</version>\n        <executions>\n          <execution>\n            <goals>\n              <goal>build</goal>\n            </goals>\n          </execution>\n        </executions>\n      </plugin>\n    </plugins>\n  </build>\n  <profiles>\n    <profile>\n      <id>native</id>\n      <activation>\n        <property>\n          <name>native</name>\n        </property>\n      </activation>\n      <properties>\n        <quarkus.package.type>native</quarkus.package.type>\n      </properties>\n      <build>\n        <plugins>\n          <plugin>\n            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n            <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>\n            <version>${surefire-plugin.version}</version>\n            <executions>\n              <execution>\n                <goals>\n                  <goal>integration-test</goal>\n                  <goal>verify</goal>\n                </goals>\n                <configuration>\n                  <systemPropertyVariables>\n                    <native.image.path>${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}-runner</native.image.path>\n                    <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>\n                    <maven.home>${maven.home}</maven.home>\n                  </systemPropertyVariables>\n                </configuration>\n              </execution>\n            </executions>\n          </plugin>\n        </plugins>\n      </build>\n    </profile>\n  </profiles>\n</project>\n----\n\n\nNow insert the copied text into the opened pom.xml. \nThe final step is to save the file by selecting *Save* in the file context menu or by using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+s and pom.xml has been changed.\n\n\n\n== Create the application.properties file\nBy default, the Swagger UI is enabled only in development mode.
